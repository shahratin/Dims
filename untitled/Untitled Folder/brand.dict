	Pregnancy category : 0
	Mode of action : Ambroxol is a metabolite of Bromhexine. It possesses mucokinetic (improvement in mucus transport) and secretolytic (liquefies secretions) properties. Ambroxol stimulates the serous cells of the glands of the mucous membrane of bronchi, increasing the content of mucus secretion. The mucolytic effect is associated with depolymerization and splitting of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharide fibres, which leads to reduction in the viscosity of mucus. Expectoration of mucus is facilitated and breathing is eased considerably. Ambroxol stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells. Ambroxol has anti-inflammatory properties. In patients with COPD, it improves airway patency.

In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibitinig activity, it is also contraindicated.
									Because of the presence of Lidocaine, it is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. 
	Side effects : Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.
									
	Precaution : History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued. Use of Diclofenac tablet in patients with hepatic porphyria may trigger an attack.
	Pregnancy category : 4
	Mode of action : Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.
	Interaction :  May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.

	Mode of action : Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.
									
									Lidocaine is an amide type local anaesth. It stabilises the neuronal membrane and inhibits Na ion movements, which are necessary for conduction of impulses. In the heart, lidocaine reduces depolarisation of the ventricles during diastole and automaticity in the His-Purkinje system. Duration of action potential and effective refractory period are also reduced.
	Interaction :  	May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.
				May increase serum levels w/ cimetidine and propranolol. Increased risk of cardiac depression w/ ?-blockers and other antiarrhythmics. Additive cardiac effects w/ IV phenytoin. Hypokalaemia caused by acetazolamide, loop diuretics and thiazides may antagonise effect of lidocaine. Dose requirements may be increased w/ long-term use of phenytoin and other enzyme-inducers.

	Mode of action : Tetracycline exhibits its bacteriostatic action by reversibly binding to the 30S subunits of the ribosome, thus preventing protein synthesis and arresting cell growth. It has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity including Chlamydiaceae, Mycoplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., spirochaetes, many aerobic and anaerobic gm+ve and gm-ve pathogenic bacteria and some protozoa.
	Interaction : Impaired absorption w/ antacids containing divalent and trivalent cations (e.g. Al, Ca, Mg), Fe, Zn and Na bicarbonate preparations, kaolin-pectin, bismuth subsalicylate, sucralfate, strontium ranelate, colestipol and colestyramine. May interfere w/ the bactericidal action of penicillin. May potentiate the effect of anticoagulants. May decrease efficacy of oral contraceptives. Nephrotoxic effects may be exacerbated by diuretics or other nephrotoxic drugs. May increase the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin and sulfonylureas in patients w/ DM. May increase toxic effects of ergot alkaloids and methotrexate.
				
				Potentially Fatal: Concurrent methoxyflurane may result to fatal renal toxicity. Increased risk of benign intracranial HTN w/ vit A or retinoids (e.g. acitretin,isotretinoin, tretinoin).

Dose may be increased up to 40 mg once daily if needed. May consider a lower starting dose in patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients receiving concomitant diuretics, especially those with renal impairment).
									 
									Child: 6 to 16 yr: 20-35 kg: 10 mg once daily, may increase to maximum of 20 mg once daily. >35 kg: 20 mg once daily, may increase to maximum of 40 mg once daily.
									
									Elderly: May consider lower starting dose of 5-10 mg daily.
	Contara-indications : Pregnancy (2nd and 3rd trimesters); biliary obstruction.
	Side effects : Dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, nausea, chest pain, bronchitis, cough, pharyngitis, rhinitis, arthritis, back pain, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, peripheral oedema, haematuria, UTI, hyperkalaemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricaemia, elevated liver enzymes, facial edema, angioedema, and rhabdomyolysis.
									Potentially Fatal: Acute renal failure.
	Precaution : Drugs that act on renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal injury and death when used in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Olmesartan medoxomil should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. May be associated with oliguria, progressive azotaemia, and acute renal failure (rare). Patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis may have increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. Caution in renal impairment; monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels periodically. Avoid use in severe renal impairment (CrCl< 20 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment. Caution in patients with aortic or mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with primary aldosteronism may not respond to angiotensin receptor antagonist. Not recommended in lactation.
	Pregnancy category : 17
	Mode of action : Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
									Olmesartan is a selective and competitive angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist that blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. As a result, olmesartan relaxes blood vessels, hence lowering BP and increases blood supply and oxygen to the heart.
	Interaction : Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.
					Increased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ ACE inhibitors, K-sparing diuretics, K salts or K supplements and drugs that may increase serum K (e.g. ciclosporin, eplerenone). May potentiate BP lowering effects w/ other antihypertensives. May decrease glomerular filtration w/ NSAIDs which can cause acute renal failure. May increase serum concentrations and toxicity of lithium.

Increased risk of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria in hypoparathyroid patients receiving high doses of vitamin D. Caution when using in patients with history of kidney stones. Renal impairment; frequent monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus is recommended.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Calcium /vitamin D3 prevents or treats negative Ca balance. It also helps facilitate nerve and muscle performance as well as normal cardiac function. Bone mineral component; cofoactor in enzymatic reactions, essential for neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and many signal transduction pathways. Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble sterol. It is necessary for the regulation and regulation of calcium and phosphate homoeostasis and bone mineralisation. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and Vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention.
	Interaction : May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D, monitor ECG and serum calcium levels.

Long-term treatment of ulcerative conditions, rosacea, pruritus; It is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris, perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infections (eg. herpes simplex, chickenpox), otitis externa with a perforated eardrum, hypersensitivity to the preparations. Scalp application is contraindicated in infection of the scalp.
	Side effects : Perioral dermatitis, striae esp in flexures. Dermal and epidermal atrophy esp on the face, steroid purpura. Potentially Fatal: Prolonged usage of large amount of clobetasol propionate can lead to sufficient systemic levels to produce adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, diabetes and hypertension.
	Precaution : Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion. If used in childhood, or on the face, courses should be limited to 5 days and occlusion should not be used. If applied to the eyelids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important.
				Scalp Application: Keep away from eye. Flammable. Do not use or dry the hair near a fire or flame.
				Scalp Shampoo: Do not use on areas other than the scalp. Keep away from eye.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Corticosteroids decrease inflammation by stabilizing leukocyte lysosomal membranes, preventing release of destructive acid hydrolases from leukocytes; inhibiting macrophage accumulation in inflamed areas; reducing leukocyte adhesion to capillary endothelium; reducing capillary wall permeability and edema formation; decreasing complement components; antagonizing histamine activity and release of kinin from substrates; and reducing fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and subsequent scar tissue formation.
	Interaction : Increased systemic exposure w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg ritonavir & itraconazole).

	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Clobetasol is a highly active corticosteroid that has topical anti-inflammatory action brought about partly by vasoconstriction and reduced collagen synthesis. Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that binds to ribosomal 30S and 50S subunits of susceptible bacteria, thus inhibiting protein synthesis; it also causes misreading of the genetic codes on the mRNA template. Nystatin works by binding to ergosterol in the cell membrane of fungus resulting in a change in the cell wall permeability and leakage of cellular components.
	Interaction : If there is substantial systemic absorption, neomycin may prolong and intensify respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blockers.

									SR Capsule : Adults and children over 12 years old - 1 capsule, once daily 
	Contara-indications : Contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Ambroxol or Bromhexine.
	Side effects : Mild GI effects and allergic reactions.
	Precaution : Ambroxol should be given cautiously to patients with gastric and duodenal ulceration or convulsive disorders. Patients with hepatic and renal insufficiency should take it with caution.
	Pregnancy category : 0
	Mode of action : Ambroxol is a metabolite of Bromhexine. It possesses mucokinetic (improvement in mucus transport) and secretolytic (liquefies secretions) properties. Ambroxol stimulates the serous cells of the glands of the mucous membrane of bronchi, increasing the content of mucus secretion. The mucolytic effect is associated with depolymerization and splitting of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharide fibres, which leads to reduction in the viscosity of mucus. Expectoration of mucus is facilitated and breathing is eased considerably. Ambroxol stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells. Ambroxol has anti-inflammatory properties. In patients with COPD, it improves airway patency.

	Contara-indications : Salbuatmol inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its components. Although intravenous Salbutamol, and occasionally Salbutamol tablets, is used in the management of premature labour uncomplicated by conditions such as placenta praevia, ante-partum haemorrhage or toxaemia of pregnancy, Salbutamol inhaler preparations are not appropriate for managing premature labour. Salbutamol preparation should not be used for threatened abortion during the first or second trimesters of pregnancy.
	Side effects : Fine skeletal muscle tremor especially hands, tachycardia, palpitations, muscle cramps, headache, paradoxical bronchospasm, angioedema, urticaria, hypotension and collapse.
									Potentially Fatal: Potentially serious hypokalaemia after large doses.
	Precaution : Salbutamol should be administered cautiously to patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis. In the event of previously effective dose of Salbuatmol inhaler failing to give relief for at least three hours, the patient should be advised to seek medical advice in order that any necessary additional steps may be taken.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Salbutamol is a direct-acting sympathomimetic with beta-adrenergic activity and selective action on ?2 receptors, producing bronchodilating effects. It also decreases uterine contractility.
	Interaction : Diuretics, corticosteroids and xanthines may augment hypokalaemia. CV effects potentiated by MAOIs, TCAs, sympathomimetics. Increases absorption of sulfamethoxazole when used together. May markedly increase heart rate and BP when used with atomoxetine. Reduces serum levels of digoxin. Hypokalaemia induced by salbutamol increases the risk of digitalis toxicity. BP should be closely monitored if linezolid is used concurrently with salbutamol.
	Therapeutic class : Short-acting selective beta2-adrenoceptor stimulants
	Packsize : 100ml bot
Actomeg 500
	n : Metformin Hydrochloride + Pioglitazone
	Indications : Type 2 DM
	Doses and administration : Dosage of this preparation must be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Pioglitazone 45 mg and Metformin 2550 mg.  
									
									It may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.
									
									The initial and maintenance dose of  it should be carefully selected in patients with advanced age due to the potential for decreased renal function in these populations. 
									
									Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of Metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly.  It should not be initiated if the patients exhibit clinical evidence of active liver disease. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended in all patients prior to initiation of therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin and periodically thereafter. 
	Contara-indications : 1. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g. as suggested by serum creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dl in male, >1.4 mg/dl in females or abnormal creatinine clearance), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction and septicemia.
									2. Known hypersensitivity to Pioglitazone, Metformin or any other component of this combination.
									3. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without coma.
	Side effects : Generally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity.
	Precaution : Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of insulin. Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases.
				
				Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive this combination.
	Pregnancy category : 13
	Mode of action : Pioglitazone is as a potent and highly selective agonist for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma. Activation of these receptors promotes the production of gene products involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. It also improves insulin response to target cells witho increasing the pancreatic secretion of insulin. Metformin decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity (increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation).
	Interaction : Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.
				Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.

Ad - All
	n : Iron + Folic acid + B Complex + Vitamin C + Zinc
	Indications : Vitamin/mineral deficiency during pregnancy and lactation
	Doses and administration : Adults (persons over 12 years of age), One (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician. Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12.
	Contara-indications :  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms.
	Side effects :  Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn and vomiting) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Reducing the dose and administering it with meals will minimize these effects in the sensitive patient. Increasing fiber in the diet can relieve constipation. Iron may turn stools black. This is a harmless effect that is a result of unabsorbed iron. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Integra FTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Integra FTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime.
	Precaution : General: Anemia is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes. No single regimen fits all cases and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential. Blood examinations including hemoglobin and hematacrit should be done at the usual intervals to make certain that therapy is adequate. Use with care in the presence of peptic ulcer, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg -0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Iron: Essential component in the formation of hemoglobin; adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropoiesis; also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport. Replacement of iron stores found in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and enzymes; works to transport oxygen via hemoglobin.
									Folic acid: Required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis; folic acid is converted in the liver and plasma to its metabolically active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, by dihydrofolate reductase; prevents neural tube defects in women of childbearing potential and higher doses required during pregnancy.
									Zinc: Cofactor in over 100 enzymes; plays a role in DNA synthesis; supports a healthy immune system; helps maintain a sense of smell and taste; may assist in porper function of insulin.
									Vitamin B: Plays a role in the synthesis and maintenance of coenzyme A. Necessary for lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, tissue respiration, glycogenolysis, inhibition of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. May increaase chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin): Required for the maintenance of normal erthropoiesis, nucleprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth; intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric mucosa, is required for active absorption of Vitamin B12 from the GI tract. Necessary for normal tissue respiration; plays a role in activation of pyridoxine and conversion of tryptophan to niacin.
									Vitamin C is necessary for collagen formation and tissue repair; plays a role in oxidation/reduction reactions as well as other metabolic pathways including synthesis of catecholamines, carnitine, and steroids; also plays a role in conversion of folic acid to folinic acid.
									
	Interaction : Iron: Antacids may decrease the absorption of carbonyl iron.
				
				Folic acid: Antiepileptics, oral contraceptives, anti-TB drugs, alcohol, aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim and sulphonamides may result to decrease in serum folate contrations. Decreases serum phenytoin concentrations.
				
				Vit C: Deferroxamine, hormonal contraceptives, flufenazine, warfarin, elemental iron, salicylates, warfarin, fluphenazine, disulfiram, mexiletine, vitamin B12.

	Side effects : Constipation, flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, pruritus, rash and urticaria.
	Precaution : Impaired calcium absorption in achlorhydria which is common in elderly. Increased risk of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria in hypoparathyroid patients receiving high doses of vitamin D. Caution when using in patients with history of kidney stones. Renal impairment; frequent monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus is recommended.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Calcium /vitamin D3 prevents or treats negative Ca balance. It also helps facilitate nerve and muscle performance as well as normal cardiac function. Bone mineral component; cofoactor in enzymatic reactions, essential for neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and many signal transduction pathways. Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble sterol. It is necessary for the regulation and regulation of calcium and phosphate homoeostasis and bone mineralisation. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and Vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention.
	Interaction : May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D, monitor ECG and serum calcium levels. Bisphosphonate or sodium fluoride should be given at least 3 hr before calcium-containing preparations.

	Doses and administration : Adults: 1- 3 tablet (50 -150 mg) daily in divided doses preferably with food or after food.
									
									Children: 1- 3 mg/kg body weight per day in divided doses.
									
									 Injections are intended for intramuscular injection.
									
									Adults: The dosage is generally one 75 mg ampoule daily. In severe cases (e.g. colic) the daily dose can exceptionally be increased to two ampoules of 75 mg, separated by an interval of a few hours. Alternatively, one ampoule of 75 mg can be combined with other dosage forms (tablets, suppositories) up to a maximum daily dosage of 150 mg.
									
									In migraine attacks, clinical experience is limited to initial use of 1 ampoule of 75 mg administered as soon as possible, followed by suppositories up to 100 mg on the same day if required. The total dosage should not exceed 175 mg on the first day.
									
									Children: In juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac sodium/kg body weight daily in divided doses.
									
									Elderly patients: The lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status or as prescribed by the physician.
									
									Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg. 
	Contara-indications : It is contra-indicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibitinig activity, it is also contraindicated.
									Because of the presence of Lidocaine, it is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. 
	Side effects : Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.
									
	Precaution : History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued. Use of Diclofenac tablet in patients with hepatic porphyria may trigger an attack.
	Pregnancy category : 4
	Mode of action : Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.
	Interaction :  May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.

Aldonist
	n : Eplerenone
	Indications : Hypertension, Heart failure, Congestive heart failure, Left ventricular dysfunction, Acute myocardial infarction
	Doses and administration : Adult: PO CHF Post-MI Initial: 25 mg once daily; titrate to recommended dose of 50 mg once daily w/in 4 wk as tolerated. Adjust dose based on serum potassium level; reduce or w/draw therapy if hyperkalaemia develops. 
									
									HTN Initial: 50 mg once daily; may increase to 50 mg twice daily based on response. Initiate at lower dose of 25 mg once daily if used concurrently w/ moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.
	Contara-indications : For all patients: Serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L at initiation; CrCl ?30 mL/min; concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir). For patients treated for hypertension: Patients with type 2 DM with microalbuminuria; serum creatinine >2 mg/dL (male), or >1.8 mg/dL (female); CrCl <50 mL/min; concomitant use of potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride, spironolactone, or triamterene).
	Side effects : Hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, cough, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, abnormal vaginal bleeding, gynaecomastia, mastodynia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, albuminuria, increased creatinine, elevated liver enzymes, increased uric acid, rash and angioneurotic oedema.
	Precaution : Measure serum potassium levels before starting therapy, within the first wk, and periodically thereafter. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with impaired renal functions; diabetic patients with CHF post-MI (especially those with proteinuria); or concurrent use of agents affecting the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Safety and efficacy not established in patients with severe hepatic impairment; or paediatric patients <18 yr. Elderly. Pregnancy and lactation.
	Pregnancy category : 2
	Mode of action : Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g. kidney, GI tract) and nonepithelial (e.g. heart, blood vessels, brain) tissues; causing increases in blood pressure by inducing sodium reabsorption, vascular remodeling, water retention and possibly other mechanisms. Eplerenone is a relatively selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, blocking binding of aldosterone and reducing blood pressure. Eplerenone also appears to have cardioprotective effect in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after myocardial infarction (MI).
	Interaction : Concomitant use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, clarithromycin, diltiazem saquinavir, verpamil, ritonavir) may increase serum concentrations of Eplerenone. CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) may decrease Eplerenone efficacy. Eplerenone may enhance hyperkalaemic effect of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium salts. Concomitant use with diazoxide, MAOIs, pentoxifylline, prostacyclin analogues may enhance hypotensive effect of antihypertensives. NSAIDs may possibly reduce the antihypertensive and/or diuretic effects of potassium-sparing diuretics and may increase risk of hyperkalaemia. Lithium toxicity has been reported when used with ACE inhibitors or diuretics; monitor lithium levels when used with Eplerenone.

	Indications : Diabetic neuropathy
	Doses and administration :     In general, for adults, take 1 tablet (50mg of the active ingredient) at a time, three times daily, before meal. The dosage may be adjusted according to the age or symptoms. Strictly follow the instructions.
									
									  
	Contara-indications :     If you have previously experienced any allergic reactions (itch, rash, etc.) to any medicines.
									
									    If you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
									
									    If you are taking any other medicinal products. (Some medicines may interact to enhance or diminish medicinal effects. Beware of over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements as well as other prescription medicines.)
	Side effects :  The most commonly reported adverse reactions include abdominal pain, nausea, rash, itch, erythema and blister. If any of these symptoms occur, consult with your doctor or pharmacist.
	Precaution : If you find your urine yellowish brown or reddish after taking the medicine, take it as usual, because the yellowish brown or reddish color is attributed to components of this medicine.
	Pregnancy category : 0
	Mode of action : Epalrestat is aldose reductase inhibitor. The aldose reductase inhibitors have a distinct mechanism of action, affecting the underlying disease process in diabetic neuropathy, although the extent of the polyol pathway involvement is yet to be determined. Epalrestat reduces sorbitol accumulation in the sciatic nerve, erythrocytes. Epalrestat may improve motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity and subjective neuropathy symptoms.

Alneed PLUS
	n : Iron + Folic acid + B Complex + Vitamin C + Zinc
	Indications : Vitamin/mineral deficiency during pregnancy and lactation
	Doses and administration : Adults (persons over 12 years of age), One (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician. Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12.
	Contara-indications :  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms.
	Side effects :  Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn and vomiting) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Reducing the dose and administering it with meals will minimize these effects in the sensitive patient. Increasing fiber in the diet can relieve constipation. Iron may turn stools black. This is a harmless effect that is a result of unabsorbed iron. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Integra FTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Integra FTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime.
	Precaution : General: Anemia is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes. No single regimen fits all cases and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential. Blood examinations including hemoglobin and hematacrit should be done at the usual intervals to make certain that therapy is adequate. Use with care in the presence of peptic ulcer, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg -0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

	Doses and administration : Adults: 1- 3 tablet (50 -150 mg) daily in divided doses preferably with food or after food.
									
									Children: 1- 3 mg/kg body weight per day in divided doses.
									
									 Injections are intended for intramuscular injection.
									
									Adults: The dosage is generally one 75 mg ampoule daily. In severe cases (e.g. colic) the daily dose can exceptionally be increased to two ampoules of 75 mg, separated by an interval of a few hours. Alternatively, one ampoule of 75 mg can be combined with other dosage forms (tablets, suppositories) up to a maximum daily dosage of 150 mg.
									
									In migraine attacks, clinical experience is limited to initial use of 1 ampoule of 75 mg administered as soon as possible, followed by suppositories up to 100 mg on the same day if required. The total dosage should not exceed 175 mg on the first day.
									
									Children: In juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac sodium/kg body weight daily in divided doses.
									
									Elderly patients: The lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status or as prescribed by the physician.
									
									Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg. 
	Contara-indications : It is contra-indicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibitinig activity, it is also contraindicated.
									Because of the presence of Lidocaine, it is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. 
	Side effects : Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.
									
	Precaution : History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued. Use of Diclofenac tablet in patients with hepatic porphyria may trigger an attack.
	Pregnancy category : 4
	Mode of action : Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.
	Interaction :  May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.

	Precaution : Ambroxol should be given cautiously to patients with gastric and duodenal ulceration or convulsive disorders. Patients with hepatic and renal insufficiency should take it with caution.
	Pregnancy category : 0
	Mode of action : Ambroxol is a metabolite of Bromhexine. It possesses mucokinetic (improvement in mucus transport) and secretolytic (liquefies secretions) properties. Ambroxol stimulates the serous cells of the glands of the mucous membrane of bronchi, increasing the content of mucus secretion. The mucolytic effect is associated with depolymerization and splitting of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharide fibres, which leads to reduction in the viscosity of mucus. Expectoration of mucus is facilitated and breathing is eased considerably. Ambroxol stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells. Ambroxol has anti-inflammatory properties. In patients with COPD, it improves airway patency.

	n : Amlodipine
	Indications : Mild to moderate hypertension, Chronic stable and vasospastic angina, Raynaud's disease, Coronary Artery Disease, HTN, Stroke prevention
	Doses and administration : Adult: PO Stable angina; HTN; Prinzmetal's angina Initial: 5 mg once daily;  If the desired therapeutic effect cannot be achieved within 2-4 weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. 
									
									Child: >12 yr Initially, 2.5 mg once daily, increased to 5 mg once daily if necessary.
									Elderly: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
									Hepatic impairment: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
	Contara-indications : Hypersensitivity to Amlodipine or other calcium channel antagonist, Severe hypertension.
	Side effects : Headache, peripheral oedema, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, palpitations, dizziness. Rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia, muscle cramps.Potentially Fatal: Hypotension, bradycardia, conductive system delay and CCF.
	Precaution : Impaired liver or renal function, CHF, sick-sinus syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis. Caution when used in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Elderly, children. Pregnancy, lactation.  Use in renal failure: Although Amlodipine is excreted primarily via kidney, mild renal impairment does not appear to have an effect on the plasma concentrations. Severe renal impairment may however require a dosage reduction. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Amlodipine half-life is prolonged in patient with impaired hepatic function. Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
	Interaction : Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.

	Indications : Patients with essential hypertension; Patients with angina pectoris & hypertension as co-existing diseases; In post MI patients; In patients with refractory angina pectoris where nitrate therapy has failed.
	Doses and administration : Adult: PO HTN; Chronic stable angina Per tab contains amlodipine (besylate) 5 mg and atenolol 25 or 50 mg: 1 tab once daily, up to 2 tab/day if needed.
	Contara-indications : Hypotension, sinus bradycardia, 2nd & 3rd degrees of heart block, cardiogenic shock, overt congestive failure, poor LV function, hypersensitivity to either component, pregnancy.
	Side effects : Headache, hypotension, dizziness, breathlessness, fatigue, muscle cramps, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, oedema, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, cold extremities. Drowsiness, chestpain & impotence rarely. Hypersensitivity reactions.
	Precaution : Excessive fall of BP may occur in elderly patients. Caution in patients with COPD, thyrotoxicosis, congestive failure, vasospastic angina, hepatic & renal impairment. Caution in diabetic patients as beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycaemia. Withdrawal should be gradual. Lactation. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Not to be used in untreated phaeochromocytoma.
	Pregnancy category : 17
	Mode of action : Atenolol is a cardioselective beta blocker. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker that blocks the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Combination of the two drugs results in additive antihypertensive action.
	Interaction : Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.

	Doses and administration : Adult: PO Stable angina; HTN; Prinzmetal's angina Initial: 5 mg once daily;  If the desired therapeutic effect cannot be achieved within 2-4 weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. 
									
									Child: >12 yr Initially, 2.5 mg once daily, increased to 5 mg once daily if necessary.
									Elderly: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
									Hepatic impairment: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
	Contara-indications : Hypersensitivity to Amlodipine or other calcium channel antagonist, Severe hypertension.
	Side effects : Headache, peripheral oedema, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, palpitations, dizziness. Rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia, muscle cramps.Potentially Fatal: Hypotension, bradycardia, conductive system delay and CCF.
	Precaution : Impaired liver or renal function, CHF, sick-sinus syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis. Caution when used in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Elderly, children. Pregnancy, lactation.  Use in renal failure: Although Amlodipine is excreted primarily via kidney, mild renal impairment does not appear to have an effect on the plasma concentrations. Severe renal impairment may however require a dosage reduction. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Amlodipine half-life is prolonged in patient with impaired hepatic function. Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
	Interaction : Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.

	Indications : Angina, Hyperlipidaemia, Hypertension, Stroke prevention
	Doses and administration : Adult: PO HTN or angina and hyperlipidaemia: 
									
									 Amlodipine: Initially 5 mg once daily, titrate over 1-2 wk; max: 10 mg/day. Atorvastatin: Initially 10-20 mg once daily (anytime of the day), patients who require >45 % reduction in LDL cholesterol may be initiated at 40 mg once daily. Titrate dose at intervals of at least 4 week; max: 80 mg/day.
	Contara-indications : Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevated hepatic transaminases. Pregnancy and lactation.
	Side effects : Amlodipine: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, peripheral oedema, flushing, palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain; rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia and muscle cramps. Atorvastatin: Nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhoea, pain in extremity, UTI, dyspepsia, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasms, myalgia, insomnia, increased transaminases, abnormal liver function test, increased creatinine phosphokinase, thrombocytopenia, malaise, hepatitis, cholestasis, bullous rashes.
									Potentially Fatal: Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.
	Precaution : Atorvastatin may cause myopathy, and rarely rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria especially at high doses or in patients with history of renal impairment. Caution when used with CYP3A4 inhibitors which may increase plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin. Withhold/discontinue Atorvastatin if symptoms suggestive of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis are observed. Atorvastatin has been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver; LFT should be monitored prior to and at 12 wk following treatment initiation and dosage increment; caution in patients who consume large amounts of alcohol or with history of liver disease. Worsening of angina and/or myocardial infarction has been reported with use of dihydrophyridine calcium channel blockers, especially in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. Amlodipine may cause dose-dependent peripheral oedema. Caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Elderly.
	Pregnancy category : 5
	Mode of action : Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker which relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It reduces peripheral vascular resistance and hence resulting in a reduction of blood pressure. In vasospastic angina, Amlodipine also inhibits coronary spasm in patients with vasopastic angina. Atorvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate which is a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
	Interaction : Rifamycins may increase the metabolism of both Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin may increase AUC of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
				Potentially Fatal: Atorvastatin: Increased risk of myopathy when used concurrently with fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, itraconazole). Cyclosporine (OATP1B1 inhibitor) may significantly increase bioavailability of Atorvastatin.

	n : Donepezil Hydrochloride
	Indications : Mild to moderately severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease.
	Doses and administration : Adult: PO Initial: 5 mg/day in the evening, up to 10 mg/day after 4-6 wk. The 5 mg (1 tab)/day dose should be maintained for at least one month in order to allow the earliest clinical responses to treatment to be assessed and to allow steady-state concentrations of donepezil hydrochloride to be achieved. 
									
									Following a one-month clinical assessment of treatment at 5 mg/day, the dose can be increased to 10 mg/day (once-a-day dosing). Since food does not affect the rate or extent of absorption of donepezil, it can be administered with or without food. 
									
									In case of renal & hepatic impairment: A similar dose schedule can be followed for patients with renal or mild to moderate hepatic impairment as clearance of donepezil hydrochloride is not affected by these conditions. 
									
									In case of children: There are no adequate and well controlled trials in document to safety and efficacy of donepezil hydrochloride in any illness occurring in children. Donepezil is not recommended for use in children.
									
	Contara-indications : Donepezil is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to donepezil hydrochloride or to piperidine derivatives.
	Side effects : Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, wt loss, diarrhoea, insomnia, fatigue, muscle cramps; headache and dizziness; syncope, bradycardia; convulsions; increased liver transaminases; sinoatrial and atrioventricular block; hallucinations, agitation and aggressive behavior; minor increases in plasma creatine kinase; potentially bladder outflow obstruction.
	Precaution : Caution when used in patients with sick sinus syndrome or cardiac conduction abnormalities. May increase secretion of gastric acid; caution when used in patients at risk of ulcer disease. Patients with COPD, asthma, history of epilepsy, bladder obstruction, prostatic hypertrophy. May cause dose-related diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomiting which usually resolves after 1-3 wk. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Pregnancy, lactation.

									Miconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis thus damaging fungal cell wall membrane and increases its permeability, allowing leakage of nutrients.
	Interaction : Metronidazole: Disulfiram-like reaction w/ alcohol. Increased oral anticoagulant effect, blood levels of phenytoin, lithium toxicity, plasma conc of astemizole & terfenadine; blood conc of carbamazepine. Decreased blood levels w/ phenobarb. Risk of CNS-related effects (eg psychotic reactions) w/ disulfiram. Increased blood levels & neurologic effects w/ cimetidine. May increase blood levels & toxicity of fluorouracil; toxicity of cyclosporine. Increased cardiotoxicity w/ amiodarone. Interference w/ blood levels of liver enzymes, glucose (hexokinase method), theophylline & procainamide. Decreased levels w/ phenytoin. 
				
				Miconazole: Increased risk of bleeding w/ acenocoumarol, anisindione, dicumarol, phenindione, phenprocoumon, warfarin; plasma conc & exposure to oxybutinin. May increase risk of phenytoin, phosphenytoin, cyclosporine, trimetrexate toxicity & cardiotoxicity w/ pimozide. May inhibit metabolism of astemizole, cisapride & terfenadine. Reduced carbamazepine metabolism. Increased or prolonged effects of opioid (fentanyl). May cause hypoglycemia w/ glimepiride. Reduced clearance & increased plasma conc of oxycodone. May increase bioavailability of tolterodine (in patients w/ deficient CYP2D6 activity).

									Severe catabolism as in burns, sepsis and trauma: up to 0.20-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day.
									
									The dosage range 0.10-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day corresponds to 15-35 ml amino acid IV/kg/day.
									In obese patients, the dose should be based on the estimated ideal weight. Depending upon patients requirements, 1000-2000 ml amino acid may be infused intravenously per 24 hours. It should be infused slowly, at rates 1.4-2.8 ml (30-60 drops) per minute.
									
									Infants and Children:
									In children and infants, the rate of infusion is 28-35 ml/kg body wt/day is recommended, with a stepwise increment in the rate of administration during the first week of treatment.
	Contara-indications : Contraindicated in patients with inborn errors of amino acids metabolism. Moreover, amino acid should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.
	Side effects : It is usually well tolerated. Yet nausea, vomiting, flushing and sweating have been observed during infusion of amino acid IV at rates exceeding the recommended maximal rate. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Like all hypertonic infusion solution, thrombophlebitis may occur when peripheral veins are used. The incidence may be reduced by the simultaneous infusion of 10% fat emulsion. If it is infused to severely ill patients, premature infants, hyperphenylalaninemia may occur.
	Precaution : Hyperphenylalaninemia has been noted in severely ill, premature infants. In these patients, monitoring of the phenylalanine levels is recommended and the infusion rate adjusted as needed.
				Do not use if the solution is turbid or contains particles. Discard any unused portion.

									 Amlodipine: Initially 5 mg once daily, titrate over 1-2 wk; max: 10 mg/day. Atorvastatin: Initially 10-20 mg once daily (anytime of the day), patients who require >45 % reduction in LDL cholesterol may be initiated at 40 mg once daily. Titrate dose at intervals of at least 4 week; max: 80 mg/day.
	Contara-indications : Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevated hepatic transaminases. Pregnancy and lactation.
	Side effects : Amlodipine: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, peripheral oedema, flushing, palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain; rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia and muscle cramps. Atorvastatin: Nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhoea, pain in extremity, UTI, dyspepsia, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasms, myalgia, insomnia, increased transaminases, abnormal liver function test, increased creatinine phosphokinase, thrombocytopenia, malaise, hepatitis, cholestasis, bullous rashes.
									Potentially Fatal: Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.
	Precaution : Atorvastatin may cause myopathy, and rarely rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria especially at high doses or in patients with history of renal impairment. Caution when used with CYP3A4 inhibitors which may increase plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin. Withhold/discontinue Atorvastatin if symptoms suggestive of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis are observed. Atorvastatin has been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver; LFT should be monitored prior to and at 12 wk following treatment initiation and dosage increment; caution in patients who consume large amounts of alcohol or with history of liver disease. Worsening of angina and/or myocardial infarction has been reported with use of dihydrophyridine calcium channel blockers, especially in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. Amlodipine may cause dose-dependent peripheral oedema. Caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Elderly.
	Pregnancy category : 5
	Mode of action : Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker which relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It reduces peripheral vascular resistance and hence resulting in a reduction of blood pressure. In vasospastic angina, Amlodipine also inhibits coronary spasm in patients with vasopastic angina. Atorvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate which is a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
	Interaction : Rifamycins may increase the metabolism of both Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin may increase AUC of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
				Potentially Fatal: Atorvastatin: Increased risk of myopathy when used concurrently with fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, itraconazole). Cyclosporine (OATP1B1 inhibitor) may significantly increase bioavailability of Atorvastatin.

	Precaution : Renal impairment; BUN >10 mmol/L, serum creatinine >130 mmol/L. Monitor serum electrolytes and blood urea levels in seriously ill patients e.g. those with hepatic cirrhosis with ascites and metabolic alkalosis, or those with resistant oedema. Pre-existing severe liver disease. May affect parathyroid function. Hyperuricaemia or gout may occur. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be increased. Thiazides may impair glucose tolerance. DM may be precipitated or aggravated. May activate or exacerbate SLE. Elderly. Hyponatraemia. Pregnancy.
	Pregnancy category : 2
	Mode of action : Amiloride is an antikaliuretic with weak natriuretic, diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Some clinical studies found these effects to be partially additive to the effects of thiazide diuretics. Amiloride exerts its potassium-sparing effect by inhibiting Na reabsorption at the distal renal tubules; this decreases the net -ve potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both K and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It reduces electrolyte reabsorption from the renal tubules. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of Na and chloride in approx equiv amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of K and bicarbonate. It exerts its hypotensive effect partly by reducing peripheral resistance.
	Interaction :  	Additive effects with other antihypertensives. May increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. May reduce arterial responsiveness to pressor amines e.g. norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension may occur with alcohol, barbiturates and narcotics. Discontinue diuretics 2-3 days before initiation of an ACE inhibitor to reduce the likelihood of 1st dose hypotension. Increased hypokalaemia with corticosteroids or ACTH. Attenuation of diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of diuretics with NSAIDs. Increased hyponatraemia with chlorpropamide. Increased hyperkalaemia with ciclosporin, tacrolimus, indometacin and angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
				Potentially Fatal: Increases risk of hyperkalaemia with other potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone or triamterene). Increases risk of lithium toxicity.

									Potentially Fatal: Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.
	Precaution : Atorvastatin may cause myopathy, and rarely rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria especially at high doses or in patients with history of renal impairment. Caution when used with CYP3A4 inhibitors which may increase plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin. Withhold/discontinue Atorvastatin if symptoms suggestive of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis are observed. Atorvastatin has been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver; LFT should be monitored prior to and at 12 wk following treatment initiation and dosage increment; caution in patients who consume large amounts of alcohol or with history of liver disease. Worsening of angina and/or myocardial infarction has been reported with use of dihydrophyridine calcium channel blockers, especially in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. Amlodipine may cause dose-dependent peripheral oedema. Caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Elderly.
	Pregnancy category : 5
	Mode of action : Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker which relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It reduces peripheral vascular resistance and hence resulting in a reduction of blood pressure. In vasospastic angina, Amlodipine also inhibits coronary spasm in patients with vasopastic angina. Atorvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate which is a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
	Interaction : Rifamycins may increase the metabolism of both Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin may increase AUC of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
				Potentially Fatal: Atorvastatin: Increased risk of myopathy when used concurrently with fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, itraconazole). Cyclosporine (OATP1B1 inhibitor) may significantly increase bioavailability of Atorvastatin.

	Doses and administration : Adult: PO Stable angina; HTN; Prinzmetal's angina Initial: 5 mg once daily;  If the desired therapeutic effect cannot be achieved within 2-4 weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. 
									
									Child: >12 yr Initially, 2.5 mg once daily, increased to 5 mg once daily if necessary.
									Elderly: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
									Hepatic impairment: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
	Contara-indications : Hypersensitivity to Amlodipine or other calcium channel antagonist, Severe hypertension.
	Side effects : Headache, peripheral oedema, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, palpitations, dizziness. Rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia, muscle cramps.Potentially Fatal: Hypotension, bradycardia, conductive system delay and CCF.
	Precaution : Impaired liver or renal function, CHF, sick-sinus syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis. Caution when used in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Elderly, children. Pregnancy, lactation.  Use in renal failure: Although Amlodipine is excreted primarily via kidney, mild renal impairment does not appear to have an effect on the plasma concentrations. Severe renal impairment may however require a dosage reduction. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Amlodipine half-life is prolonged in patient with impaired hepatic function. Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
	Interaction : Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.
	Therapeutic class : Calcium-channel blockers
	Packsize : 50's pack
Amlobet 5/50
	n : Amlodipine  +  Atenolol
	Indications : Patients with essential hypertension; Patients with angina pectoris & hypertension as co-existing diseases; In post MI patients; In patients with refractory angina pectoris where nitrate therapy has failed.
	Doses and administration : Adult: PO HTN; Chronic stable angina Per tab contains amlodipine (besylate) 5 mg and atenolol 25 or 50 mg: 1 tab once daily, up to 2 tab/day if needed.
	Contara-indications : Hypotension, sinus bradycardia, 2nd & 3rd degrees of heart block, cardiogenic shock, overt congestive failure, poor LV function, hypersensitivity to either component, pregnancy.
	Side effects : Headache, hypotension, dizziness, breathlessness, fatigue, muscle cramps, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, oedema, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, cold extremities. Drowsiness, chestpain & impotence rarely. Hypersensitivity reactions.
	Precaution : Excessive fall of BP may occur in elderly patients. Caution in patients with COPD, thyrotoxicosis, congestive failure, vasospastic angina, hepatic & renal impairment. Caution in diabetic patients as beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycaemia. Withdrawal should be gradual. Lactation. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Not to be used in untreated phaeochromocytoma.
	Pregnancy category : 17
	Mode of action : Atenolol is a cardioselective beta blocker. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker that blocks the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Combination of the two drugs results in additive antihypertensive action.
	Interaction : Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.

									Elderly: May consider lower starting dose of 5-10 mg daily.
	Contara-indications : Pregnancy (2nd and 3rd trimesters); biliary obstruction.
	Side effects : Dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, nausea, chest pain, bronchitis, cough, pharyngitis, rhinitis, arthritis, back pain, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, peripheral oedema, haematuria, UTI, hyperkalaemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricaemia, elevated liver enzymes, facial edema, angioedema, and rhabdomyolysis.
									Potentially Fatal: Acute renal failure.
	Precaution : Drugs that act on renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal injury and death when used in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Olmesartan medoxomil should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. May be associated with oliguria, progressive azotaemia, and acute renal failure (rare). Patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis may have increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. Caution in renal impairment; monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels periodically. Avoid use in severe renal impairment (CrCl< 20 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment. Caution in patients with aortic or mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with primary aldosteronism may not respond to angiotensin receptor antagonist.

	Mode of action : Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
									Olmesartan is a selective and competitive angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist that blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. As a result, olmesartan relaxes blood vessels, hence lowering BP and increases blood supply and oxygen to the heart.
	Interaction : Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.
					Increased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ ACE inhibitors, K-sparing diuretics, K salts or K supplements and drugs that may increase serum K (e.g. ciclosporin, eplerenone). May potentiate BP lowering effects w/ other antihypertensives. May decrease glomerular filtration w/ NSAIDs which can cause acute renal failure. May increase serum concentrations and toxicity of lithium.

	Contara-indications : Hypotension, sinus bradycardia, 2nd & 3rd degrees of heart block, cardiogenic shock, overt congestive failure, poor LV function, hypersensitivity to either component, pregnancy.
	Side effects : Headache, hypotension, dizziness, breathlessness, fatigue, muscle cramps, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, oedema, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, cold extremities. Drowsiness, chestpain & impotence rarely. Hypersensitivity reactions.
	Precaution : Excessive fall of BP may occur in elderly patients. Caution in patients with COPD, thyrotoxicosis, congestive failure, vasospastic angina, hepatic & renal impairment. Caution in diabetic patients as beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycaemia. Withdrawal should be gradual. Lactation. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Not to be used in untreated phaeochromocytoma.
	Pregnancy category : 17
	Mode of action : Atenolol is a cardioselective beta blocker. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker that blocks the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Combination of the two drugs results in additive antihypertensive action.
	Interaction : Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.

									Child: >12 yr Initially, 2.5 mg once daily, increased to 5 mg once daily if necessary.
									Elderly: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
									Hepatic impairment: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
	Contara-indications : Hypersensitivity to Amlodipine or other calcium channel antagonist, Severe hypertension.
	Side effects : Headache, peripheral oedema, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, palpitations, dizziness. Rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia, muscle cramps.Potentially Fatal: Hypotension, bradycardia, conductive system delay and CCF.
	Precaution : Impaired liver or renal function, CHF, sick-sinus syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis. Caution when used in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Elderly, children. Pregnancy, lactation.  Use in renal failure: Although Amlodipine is excreted primarily via kidney, mild renal impairment does not appear to have an effect on the plasma concentrations. Severe renal impairment may however require a dosage reduction. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Amlodipine half-life is prolonged in patient with impaired hepatic function. Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
	Interaction : Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.

	Precaution : Discontinue Amlodipine+Benazepril as soon as possible if pregnancy is detected. Caution in elderly, renal or hepatic impairment, congestive heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, use during surgery or anaesthesia. Amlodipine+Benazepril can cause symptomatic hypotension, especially in patients with salt/volume depletion. ACE inhibitors (ACEi) have been associated with cholestatic jaundice and fulminant hepatic necrosis; discontinue treatment if patient develops jaundice/marked elevation of liver enzymes. Monitor renal function and serum potassium periodically. Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, larynx and intestinal angioedema have been reported in ACEi-treated patients. As with all ACEi, may cause persistent dry cough. Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients have not been established.
	Pregnancy category : 17
	Mode of action : Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. It lowers BP by relaxing the coronary vascular smooth muscles and producing coronary vasodilation; through inhibition of transmembrane Ca ion influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. It is also a peripheral vascular vasodilator. Benazepril and its active metabolite benazeprilat inhibit ACE, which results in decreased plasma angiotensin II and thus leading to decreased aldosterone secretion.
	Interaction : Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.

Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
	Interaction : Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.

	Doses and administration : Adults and children over 12 years: One 375 mg tablet 3 times a day. In severe infection one 625mg tablet 3 times a day or one 1gm tablet two times a day. 
									
									Children of 6-12 years:  2 teaspoonful Powder for Suspension every 8 hours. 
									Children of 1-6 years: 1 teaspoonful Powder for Suspension every 8 hours. 
									Children below 1 year: 25 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours. 
									
									Adults and children over 12 years: IV Injection: 1.2 g every 6-8 hours, 
									Children up to 3 months: 30 mg/kg every 8 hours (every 12 hours in the perinatal period and in premature infants); 
									child 3 months-12 years, 30 mg/kg every 6-8 hours.
									
	Contara-indications : Penicillin allergy.
	Side effects : Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, rash and urticaria, candida superinfection.
									Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reaction with CV collapse esp with parenteral use.
	Precaution : History of allergy especially to cephalosporins, infectious mononucleosis, severe renal impairment.
	Pregnancy category : 2
	Mode of action : Clavulanic acid has a high affinity for and binds to certain ?-lactamases that generally inactivate amoxicillin by hydrolyzing its ?-lactam ring. Combining clavulanate potassium with amoxicillin extends the antibacterial spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other penicillins and cephalosporins.
	Interaction : Allopurinol may reduce renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin thus increasing the serum levels of amoxicillin. Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.
	Therapeutic class : Broad spectrum penicillins

Amovast
	n : Amlodipine 5mg + Atorvastatin 10mg
	Indications : Angina, Hyperlipidaemia, Hypertension, Stroke prevention
	Doses and administration : Adult: PO HTN or angina and hyperlipidaemia: 
									
									 Amlodipine: Initially 5 mg once daily, titrate over 1-2 wk; max: 10 mg/day. Atorvastatin: Initially 10-20 mg once daily (anytime of the day), patients who require >45 % reduction in LDL cholesterol may be initiated at 40 mg once daily. Titrate dose at intervals of at least 4 week; max: 80 mg/day.
	Contara-indications : Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevated hepatic transaminases. Pregnancy and lactation.
	Side effects : Amlodipine: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, peripheral oedema, flushing, palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain; rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia and muscle cramps. Atorvastatin: Nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhoea, pain in extremity, UTI, dyspepsia, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasms, myalgia, insomnia, increased transaminases, abnormal liver function test, increased creatinine phosphokinase, thrombocytopenia, malaise, hepatitis, cholestasis, bullous rashes.
									Potentially Fatal: Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.
	Precaution : Atorvastatin may cause myopathy, and rarely rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria especially at high doses or in patients with history of renal impairment. Caution when used with CYP3A4 inhibitors which may increase plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin. Withhold/discontinue Atorvastatin if symptoms suggestive of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis are observed. Atorvastatin has been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver; LFT should be monitored prior to and at 12 wk following treatment initiation and dosage increment; caution in patients who consume large amounts of alcohol or with history of liver disease. Worsening of angina and/or myocardial infarction has been reported with use of dihydrophyridine calcium channel blockers, especially in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. Amlodipine may cause dose-dependent peripheral oedema. Caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Elderly.
	Pregnancy category : 5
	Mode of action : Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker which relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It reduces peripheral vascular resistance and hence resulting in a reduction of blood pressure. In vasospastic angina, Amlodipine also inhibits coronary spasm in patients with vasopastic angina. Atorvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate which is a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.
	Interaction : Rifamycins may increase the metabolism of both Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin may increase AUC of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
				Potentially Fatal: Atorvastatin: Increased risk of myopathy when used concurrently with fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, itraconazole). Cyclosporine (OATP1B1 inhibitor) may significantly increase bioavailability of Atorvastatin.

	Precaution : Excessive fall of BP may occur in elderly patients. Caution in patients with COPD, thyrotoxicosis, congestive failure, vasospastic angina, hepatic & renal impairment. Caution in diabetic patients as beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycaemia. Withdrawal should be gradual. Lactation. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Not to be used in untreated phaeochromocytoma.
	Pregnancy category : 17
	Mode of action : Atenolol is a cardioselective beta blocker. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker that blocks the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Combination of the two drugs results in additive antihypertensive action.
	Interaction : Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.

	Precaution : Ambroxol should be given cautiously to patients with gastric and duodenal ulceration or convulsive disorders. Patients with hepatic and renal insufficiency should take it with caution.
	Pregnancy category : 0
	Mode of action : Ambroxol is a metabolite of Bromhexine. It possesses mucokinetic (improvement in mucus transport) and secretolytic (liquefies secretions) properties. Ambroxol stimulates the serous cells of the glands of the mucous membrane of bronchi, increasing the content of mucus secretion. The mucolytic effect is associated with depolymerization and splitting of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharide fibres, which leads to reduction in the viscosity of mucus. Expectoration of mucus is facilitated and breathing is eased considerably. Ambroxol stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells. Ambroxol has anti-inflammatory properties. In patients with COPD, it improves airway patency.

	Interaction : Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.
	Therapeutic class : Combined antihypertensive preparations

Amtinol
	n : Amlodipine
	Indications : Mild to moderate hypertension, Chronic stable and vasospastic angina, Raynaud's disease, Coronary Artery Disease, HTN, Stroke prevention
	Doses and administration : Adult: PO Stable angina; HTN; Prinzmetal's angina Initial: 5 mg once daily;  If the desired therapeutic effect cannot be achieved within 2-4 weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. 
									
									Child: >12 yr Initially, 2.5 mg once daily, increased to 5 mg once daily if necessary.
									Elderly: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
									Hepatic impairment: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
	Contara-indications : Hypersensitivity to Amlodipine or other calcium channel antagonist, Severe hypertension.
	Side effects : Headache, peripheral oedema, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, palpitations, dizziness. Rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia, muscle cramps.Potentially Fatal: Hypotension, bradycardia, conductive system delay and CCF.
	Precaution : Impaired liver or renal function, CHF, sick-sinus syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis. Caution when used in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Elderly, children. Pregnancy, lactation.  Use in renal failure: Although Amlodipine is excreted primarily via kidney, mild renal impairment does not appear to have an effect on the plasma concentrations. Severe renal impairment may however require a dosage reduction. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Amlodipine half-life is prolonged in patient with impaired hepatic function. Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
	Interaction : Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.

It reversibly inhibits the cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and -2) enzymes, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors. It can inhibit platelet aggregation, has anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions.
									
									Esomeprazole is a PPI that suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting H+/K+ ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. It is the S-isomer of omeprazole.
	Interaction : Increased risk of digoxin-induced cardiotoxic effects. Increased risk of hypomagnesaemia w/ diuretics. May increase INR and prothrombin time w/ warfarin. May increase serum concentration of tacrolimus, saquinavir, methotrexate. May interfere the elimination of drugs metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. diazepam). May decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole, erlotinib and Fe salts.
				Potentially Fatal: May decrease serum concentration and pharmacological effects of rilpivirine, atazanavir and nelfinavir. May decrease the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel.

Intravenous injection should only be given by the physician.In atrial fibrillation and simultaneous WPW syndrome there is a risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Verapamil inhibits entry of calcium ions into arterial smooth muscle cells as well as the myocytes and conducting tissue. These actions lead to reversal and preventions of coronary artery spasm, reduction in afterload through peripheral vasodilatation and reduction in ventricular rate in patients with chronic atrial flutter or fibrillation and reduction in the occurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Verapamil reduces BP, relieves angina and slows AV conduction.
	Interaction : Increased cardiac depressant effects with ?-blockers and flecainide. Increased risk of additive bradycardia, conduction disturbances and digoxin toxicity with digoxin. Increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension with remifentanil and sufentanil. Increased levels of both everolimus and verapamil on concurrent use. May increase doxorubicin, buspirone, carbamazepine, ciclosporin, epirubicin, eplerenone, quinidine, statins, sirolimus, tacrolimus, quinupristin/dalfopristin levels.

	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Glyceryl trinitrate acts on the enzyme nitric oxide stimulating guanylate cyclase in the vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in the relaxation of smooth muscles. It reduces venous return (preload) and facilitates subendocardial blood flow with redistribution into ischaemic areas. It relieves coronary vasospasm and dilates arterioles reducing afterload. It is useful for relief and prevention of anginal attacks.
	Interaction : Enhances bioavailability of dihydroergotamine. Glyceryl trinitrate infusion may prolong pancuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. May reduce the efficacy of heparin, alteplase and noradrenaline when used together. Efficacy of buccal and sublingual preparations may be reduced by drugs that can cause dry mouth due to decreased dissolution. Aspirin and other NSAIDs may reduce the therapeutic response to glyceryl trinitrate.
				Potentially Fatal: Orthostatic hypotension may be produced by combined use of calcium channel blockers, antihypertensives, phenothiazines and TCAs. Alcohol may cause severe hypotension and collapse.

	Side effects : Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.
									The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly involve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are dose related. The CNS reaction may be manifested by drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lightheadness, etc. Incase of eye drops ocular burning sensation or allergic reaction may occur in 5-10% patients. 
									
	Precaution : History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued.
	Pregnancy category : 19
	Mode of action : Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.
									
									Lidocaine is an amide type local anaesth. It stabilises the neuronal membrane and inhibits Na ion movements, which are necessary for conduction of impulses. In the heart, lidocaine reduces depolarisation of the ventricles during diastole and automaticity in the His-Purkinje system. Duration of action potential and effective refractory period are also reduced.
	Interaction :  	May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.
				May increase serum levels w/ cimetidine and propranolol. Increased risk of cardiac depression w/ ?-blockers and other antiarrhythmics. Additive cardiac effects w/ IV phenytoin. Hypokalaemia caused by acetazolamide, loop diuretics and thiazides may antagonise effect of lidocaine. Dose requirements may be increased w/ long-term use of phenytoin and other enzyme-inducers.

	Contara-indications : Midazolam must not be given to patients with severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea syndrome and with known hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines or to any component of the product.
	Side effects : At the start of therapy, drowsiness during daytime, confusion, fatigue, headache and muscle weakness may occur which usually disappear with repeated administration. Following parenteral (IV or IM) administration of Midazolam, fluctuations in vital signs have been noted including respiratory depression, apnoea, variations in blood pressure and pulse rate.
	Precaution : Midazolam IV should be administered very slowly.
	Pregnancy category : 4
	Mode of action : Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine. It exerts sedative and hypnotic, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant actions. While the probable anxiolytic action might be as a result of the drug's ability to increase glycine inhibitory neurotransmitter level, the hypnotic/anaesthetic action may be due to the occupation of the benzodiazepine and GABA receptors leading to membrane hyperpolarisation and neuronal inhibition, and further interfering with the re-uptake of GABA at the synapses.
	Interaction : Increased CNS depression with alcohol, opioids, barbiturates, other sedatives and anaesthetics. Increased respiratory depression with opiates, phenobarbital, other benzodiazepines. Plasma concentrations increased by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole and itraconazole, antiretroviral agents, quinupristin with dalfopristin. Midazolam concentration decreased by phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampicin. Halothane, thiopental requirements may be reduced during concurrent use.

Ansulin N
	n : Insulin (Human) N
	Indications : Diabetes mellitus
	Doses and administration : Adult:  SC DM Dosage should be individualised and adjusted based on patient's glycaemic response. Usual range: 0.5-1 u/kg/day.
	Contara-indications : Hypoglycaemia. Hypersensitivity to any of the components. 
	Side effects : Adverse events commonly associated with human insulin therapy include the following:  Allergic reactions.  Injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, lipoatrophy, hypokalaemia, blurred vision. Hypoglycaemia, insulin resistance
	Precaution : Pregnancy (insulin requirements tend to fall during the 1st trimester, increase during the 2nd and 3rd) and lactation. During infection.
	Pregnancy category : 2
	Mode of action : Insulin lowers blood glucose levels. It regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, and enhancing peripheral glucose disposal. The various insulin formulations are classified according to their durations of action after SC Inj. They are divided into short-, intermediate-, or long-acting insulin. Soluble insulin (also known as 'neutral insulin' or 'regular insulin') is a short-acting preparation. 
									
									To extend the duration of action of insulin, preparations are formulated as suspensions in 2 methods. The 1st method involves complexing insulin with a protein so that it is slowly released, e.g. protamine zinc insulin (contains an excess of protamine) and isophane insulin (or NPH insulin which contains equal amounts of protamine and insulin). An alternative method is particle size modification e.g. insulin zinc suspensions. While all the formulations can be admin by SC inj, most by IM inj, only soluble insulin can be admin by IV. Compared to SC inj, IM admin usually has a faster onset of action, with a shorter duration of action.
	Interaction : Possible absence of hypoglycaemic warning symptoms with ?-blockers. Decreased hypoglycaemic effect with corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents, thyroid hormones, oestrogens, progestins (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Increased hypoglycaemic effect with oral antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, MAOIs, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics. Decreased insulin resistance with octreotide and lanreotide. Increased risk of wt gain and peripheral oedema with pioglitazone, rosiglitazone. Decreased effect of sermorelin.

	Contara-indications : Hypoglycaemia. Hypersensitivity to any of the components. 
	Side effects : Adverse events commonly associated with human insulin therapy include the following:  Allergic reactions.  Injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, lipoatrophy, hypokalaemia, blurred vision. Hypoglycaemia, insulin resistance
	Precaution : Pregnancy (insulin requirements tend to fall during the 1st trimester, increase during the 2nd and 3rd) and lactation. During infection.
	Pregnancy category : 2
	Mode of action : Insulin lowers blood glucose levels. It regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, and enhancing peripheral glucose disposal. The various insulin formulations are classified according to their durations of action after SC Inj. They are divided into short-, intermediate-, or long-acting insulin. Soluble insulin (also known as 'neutral insulin' or 'regular insulin') is a short-acting preparation. 
									
									To extend the duration of action of insulin, preparations are formulated as suspensions in 2 methods. The 1st method involves complexing insulin with a protein so that it is slowly released, e.g. protamine zinc insulin (contains an excess of protamine) and isophane insulin (or NPH insulin which contains equal amounts of protamine and insulin). An alternative method is particle size modification e.g. insulin zinc suspensions. While all the formulations can be admin by SC inj, most by IM inj, only soluble insulin can be admin by IV. Compared to SC inj, IM admin usually has a faster onset of action, with a shorter duration of action.
	Interaction : Possible absence of hypoglycaemic warning symptoms with ?-blockers. Decreased hypoglycaemic effect with corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents, thyroid hormones, oestrogens, progestins (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Increased hypoglycaemic effect with oral antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, MAOIs, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics. Decreased insulin resistance with octreotide and lanreotide. Increased risk of wt gain and peripheral oedema with pioglitazone, rosiglitazone. Decreased effect of sermorelin.

	n : Atorvastatin
	Indications :  Primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial), Mixed Dyslipidemia, Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, Hypertriglyceridemia, Familial hypercholesterolemia, Cardiovascular event prevention, Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia
	Doses and administration : Oral
									Mixed dyslipidaemia, Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, Nonfamilial hypercholesterolaemia
									Adult: Initially, 10 or 20 mg once daily, may be adjusted at 4-wk interval. May initiate 40 mg once daily in patients who require >45% reduction in LDL-cholesterol. Max: 80 mg/day.
									
									Child: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: 10-17 yr 10 mg once daily, may increase at intervals of at least 4 wk to max 20 mg/day.
									Elderly: No dosage adjustment needed.
									
									Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. Therapy should be individualized according to goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of Atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the LDL-C levels should be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should total-C be used to monitor therapy. 
									
									Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage of Atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (eg, LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 
									
									Dosage in Patients with Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary. 
									
									Pediatric Use: Treatment experience in a pediatric population is limited to doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day for 1 year in 8 patients with homozygous FH. No clinical or biochemical abnormalities were reported in these patients. None of these patients was below 9 years of age. 
									
									Geriatric Use: Treatment experience in adult’s age 70 years with doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day has been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of Atorvastatin in this population were similar to those of patients <70 years of age.
									
	Contara-indications : Hypersensitivity, active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminase, porphyria, pregnancy, lactation.
	Side effects : Headache, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, xerostomia, angioedema, myalgia, rash/pruritus, alopecia, allergy, infection, chest pain.Potentially Fatal: Thrombocytopenia. Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.
	Precaution : Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. History of liver disease. Patients with risk factors for myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Hypothyroidism should be properly managed prior to starting statin therapy. Children <10 yr. Premenarcheal females.
	Pregnancy category : 5
	Mode of action : Atorvastatin competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. This results in the induction of the LDL receptors and stimulation of LDL catabolism, leading to lowered LDL-cholesterol levels.
	Interaction : May increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis w/ CYP3A4 potent inhibitor (e.g. HIV or HCV protease inhibitors, itraconazole, clarithromycin), fenofibrate, colchicines, fixed combination of lopinavir/ritonavir. May decrease plasma concentration w/ CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. rifampicin, efavirenz). May significantly increase AUC and peak plasma concentration of digoxin. Increased AUC for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
				Potentially Fatal: Increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis w/ ciclosporin, gemfibrozil, telaprevir, tipranavir.

									Children: 1- 3 mg/kg body weight per day in divided doses.
									
									 Injections are intended for intramuscular injection.
									
									Adults: The dosage is generally one 75 mg ampoule daily. In severe cases (e.g. colic) the daily dose can exceptionally be increased to two ampoules of 75 mg, separated by an interval of a few hours. Alternatively, one ampoule of 75 mg can be combined with other dosage forms (tablets, suppositories) up to a maximum daily dosage of 150 mg.
									
									In migraine attacks, clinical experience is limited to initial use of 1 ampoule of 75 mg administered as soon as possible, followed by suppositories up to 100 mg on the same day if required. The total dosage should not exceed 175 mg on the first day.
									
									Children: In juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac sodium/kg body weight daily in divided doses.
									
									Elderly patients: The lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status or as prescribed by the physician.
									
									Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg. 
	Contara-indications : It is contra-indicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibitinig activity, it is also contraindicated.
									Because of the presence of Lidocaine, it is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. 
	Side effects : Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.
									
	Precaution : History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued. Use of Diclofenac tablet in patients with hepatic porphyria may trigger an attack.
	Pregnancy category : 4
	Mode of action : Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.
	Interaction :  May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate.

	n : Dextrose 10% + Sodium Chloride 0.225%
	Indications : Dehydration, Fluid and Electrolytes imbalance
	Doses and administration : The dose is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical condition of the patient.
									
									As reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia.
									
									Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.
	Contara-indications : Hypersensitivity.
	Side effects : Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.
									
									If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.
	Precaution : Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.
				
				Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.
				
				Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.
				
				Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion.

In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibitinig activity, it is also contraindicated.
									Because of the presence of Lidocaine, it is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. 
	Side effects : Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.
									
	Precaution : History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued. Use of Diclofenac tablet in patients with hepatic porphyria may trigger an attack.
	Pregnancy category : 4
	Mode of action : Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.
	Interaction :  May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.

Renal impairment; frequent monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus is recommended.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Calcium /vitamin D3 prevents or treats negative Ca balance. It also helps facilitate nerve and muscle performance as well as normal cardiac function. Bone mineral component; cofoactor in enzymatic reactions, essential for neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and many signal transduction pathways. Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble sterol. It is necessary for the regulation and regulation of calcium and phosphate homoeostasis and bone mineralisation. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and Vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention.
	Interaction : May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D.

Apresin
	n : Fluphenazine Hydrochloride + Nortriptyline
	Indications : Headache, Depression, Anxiety, Emotional disturbance, Tension, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Bodyache, Gastric problems
	Doses and administration : Adult: 1 tablet 2 to 3 times daily.
									Child: Not recommended.
	Contara-indications : Patients with suspected or established subcortical brain damage, in patients receiving large doses of hypnotics, and in comatose or severely depressed states. The presence of blood dyscrasia or liver damage precludes the use of fluphenazine hydrochloride. Fluphenazine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to fluphenazine; cross sensitivity to phenothiazine derivatives may occur.
	Side effects : Dryness of mouth, drowsiness, constipation, tachycardia, nasal congestion, blurred vision and excitement.
	Precaution : Patients with glaucoma, prostate enlargement, cardiac failure and myocardial infarction. The drug may impair alertness and abilities to drive a car or operating machinery.
				
				Because of the possibility of cross-sensitivity, fluphenazine hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients who have developed cholestatic jaundice, dermatoses or other allergic reactions to phenothiazine derivatives.
				
				Psychotic patients on large doses of a phenothiazine drug who are undergoing surgery should be watched carefully for possible hypotensive phenomena. Moreover, it should be remembered that reduced amounts of anesthetics or central nervous system depressants may be necessary.
				
				The effects of atropine may be potentiated in some patients receiving fluphenazine because of added anticholinergic effects.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Fluphenazine blocks postsynaptic dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the mesolimbic system and decreases the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones. It reduces aggressiveness with disappearance of hallucinations and delusions.
									
									Nortriptyline, a dibenzocycloheptadiene tricyclic antidepressant, is the primary active metabolite of amitriptyline. It increases synaptic concentration of serotonin and/or norepinephrine in the CNS by blocking the neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.
	Interaction : Reduces antihypertensive effects of guanethidine, methyldopa and clonidine. Lithium toxicity. Reduced bioavailability with antacids. Increased risk of arrhythmia when used with drugs that prolong QT interval. May cause electrolyte disturbance when used with diuretics.
				Potentially Fatal: Additive CNS depressant effects with alcohol, barbiturates, hypnotics, sedatives, opiates and antihistamines.

									Corneal Ulcers: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of corneal ulcers is 2 drops into the affected eye every 15 minutes for the first 6 hours and then 2 drops into the affected eye every 30 minutes for the remainder of the first day. On the second day, instill 2 drops in the affected eye hourly. On the third through the fourteenth day, place 2 drops in the affected eye every four hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred.
									Conjunctivitis: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis is 1 or 2 drops instilled into the conjunctival sac(s) every 2 hours while awake for 2 days and one or 2 drops every 4 hours while awake for the next 5 days.
									
									Eye ointment: A thin film of Aprocin Sterile Eye Ointment should evenly be applied either directly to the affected part or inside the lower conjunctival sac at night (if eye drops used during the day) or 3-4 times daily depending on the severity of the condition (if eye ointment used alone).
									
									Ear drops: 
									For all infections, 2-3 drops every 2-3 hours initially, reducing the frequency of the instillation with control of infection. Treatment should be continued at least 7 days. 
	Contara-indications : Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated in patients who have hypersensitivity to Ciprofloxacin or other quinolones.
	Side effects : Local burning or discomfort, itching, foreign body sensation, crystalline precipitates, lid margin crusting, conjunctival hyperemia and a bad taste following administration. Photophobia and nausea may be reported.
	Precaution : Prolonged use of Ciprofloxacin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi. Ciprofloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity reaction. Not for injection into the eye.
	Pregnancy category : 3
	Mode of action : Ciprofloxacin promotes breakage of double-stranded DNA in susceptible organisms and inhibits DNA gyrase, which is essential in reproduction of bacterial DNA.
	Interaction : May increase plasma concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. clozapine, ropinirole, theophylline). Enhances effect of oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) and glibenclamide. Increased toxicity of methotrexate. Plasma concentrations may be increased by probenecid. Reduced absorption w/ oral multivitamins and mineral supplements containing divalent or trivalent cations (e.g. Fe, Zn, Ca) and antacids containing Al, Ca or Mg. Concomitant use w/ class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, procainamide), class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), TCAs, macrolides and antipsychotics may result in additive effects on QT interval prolongation. Concurrent use w/ corticosteroids may increase risk of severe tendon disorders. Increased risk of CNS stimulation w/ NSAIDs. Altered serum concentrations of phenytoin.
				Potentially Fatal: Marked elevation in serum levels of tizanidine which is associated w/ potentiated hypotensive and sedative effect.

	Mode of action : Calcium /vitamin D3 prevents or treats negative Ca balance. It also helps facilitate nerve and muscle performance as well as normal cardiac function. Bone mineral component; cofoactor in enzymatic reactions, essential for neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and many signal transduction pathways. Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble sterol. It is necessary for the regulation and regulation of calcium and phosphate homoeostasis and bone mineralisation. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and Vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention.
	Interaction : May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D, monitor ECG and serum calcium levels. Bisphosphonate or sodium fluoride should be given at least 3 hr before calcium-containing preparations.

									When switching from combination therapy of Rosiglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets, the usual starting dose  is the dose of Rosiglitazone and Metformin already being taken. If additional glycemic control is needed, the daily dose may be increased by increment of 4 mg Rosiglitazone and/or 500 mg Metformin, up to the maximum recommended total daily dose of 8 mg/2000 mg.
	Contara-indications : It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by serum creatinine levels .1.5 mg/dl (males), 1.4 mg/dl (females), or abnormal creatinine clearance), acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma & known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone maleate or metformin HCl.
	Side effects : Rosiglitazone: The commonly reported adverse events are upper respiratory tract infections, injury, headache, back pain, fatigue, sinusitis, diarrhoea and hypoglycemia. There were a small number of patients who had anemia and edema. All these events were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment with Rosiglitazone.
									Metformin: Some patients may develop asymptomatic subnormal levels of serum vitamin B12.
									Incidence of lactic acidosis is also very rare. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, flatulence and anorexia are common reactions to Metformin.
	Precaution : Rosiglitazone: should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. This should be used with caution in patients with edema. Dose-related weight gain was seen with rosiglitazone alone and rosiglitazone together with other hypoglycemic agents.
				
				Metformin: Monitoring of renal function: Patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal should not receive this tablet. In patients with advanced age, the dose should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. 
	Pregnancy category : 13
	Mode of action : Rosiglitazone: Lowers glucose by improving target cell response to insulin without increasing pancreatic cell secretion; activates nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which influences the production of gene products involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.
									
									Metformin: Biguanide; acts by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization; improves glucose tolerance and lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .
	Interaction : Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.
				Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.

									local anaesthetic of mouth/throat impairs swallowing and increases the risk of aspiration (patients cautioned against eating or drinking for 3-4 hr after anaesthesia); transient effect on auditory system of neonate; erythema; pigmentation; pain; headache; palpitations; local necrosis; pulmonary oedema; hyperglycaemia; bradycardia; reduced cardiac output; anxiety. 
									Epidural may cause hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting. Intraoral inj may cause stress reactions such as diaphoresis, palpitation, hyperventilation, generalised pallor and faintness. 
									Topically: papules, burns, rash, skin irritation, burning sensation and blanching.
									Potentially Fatal: CNS toxicity (due to inadvertent IV admin), medullary depression with tonic & clonic convulsions; ventricular fibrillation; severe hypertension with cerebral haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema; unconsciousness; possibly respiratory arrest. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and possibly life threatening asthmatic episodes in susceptible patients may occur due to sodium metabisulphate constituent. Central nerve blocks may cause CV depression (especially in hypovolaemia). Retrobulbar inj may reach subarachnoid space causing CV collapse, apnoea, convulsions, temporary blindness. Paracervical block may cause foetal bradycardia/tachycardia (careful monitoring of foetal heart rate is necessary).
	Precaution : Epilepsy, impaired cardiac conduction, CHF, DM, closed angle glaucoma, impaired liver function (if site of admin is likely to result in high blood levels), severe renal dysfunction.
