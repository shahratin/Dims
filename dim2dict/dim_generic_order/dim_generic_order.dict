Contra-indication: Tachycardia, hypertension, cerebral arteriosclerosis, ischaemic heart disease, IV admin, anaesthetise digits or appendages, myasthenia gravis.

Side effects: Severity of adverse effects in CNS and CVS are directly related to blood levels of lidocaine; the effects are more likely to occur after systemic administration rather than infiltration; dizziness; muscle twitching; local anaesthetic of mouth/throat impairs swallowing and increases the risk of aspiration (patients cautioned against eating or drinking for 3-4 hr after anaesthesia); transient effect on auditory system of neonate; erythema; pigmentation; pain; headache; palpitations; local necrosis; pulmonary oedema; hyperglycaemia; bradycardia; reduced cardiac output; anxiety. 

Epidural may cause hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting. Intraoral inj may cause stress reactions such as diaphoresis, palpitation, hyperventilation, generalised pallor and faintness. Topically: papules, burns, rash, skin irritation, burning sensation and blanching.

Potentially Fatal: Severity of adverse effects in CNS and CVS related to blood levels of lidocaine; effects more likely to occur after systemic administration rather than infiltration. CNS toxicity (due to inadvertent IV admin), medullary depression with tonic & clonic convulsions; ventricular fibrillation; severe hypertension with cerebral haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema; unconsciousness; possibly respiratory arrest. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and possibly life threatening asthmatic episodes in susceptible patients may occur due to sodium metabisulphate constituent. 

Central nerve blocks may cause CV depression (especially in hypovolaemia). Retrobulbar inj may reach subarachnoid space causing CV collapse, apnoea, convulsions, temporary blindness. Paracervical block may cause foetal bradycardia/tachycardia (careful monitoring of foetal heart rate is necessary).

Precaution: Epilepsy, impaired cardiac conduction, CHF, DM, closed angle glaucoma, impaired liver function (if site of admin is likely to result in high blood levels), severe renal dysfunction. Local anaesthetic effect may be reduced if injected into an inflamed or infected area. Cerebrovascular insufficiency, hyperthyroidism. Neonates, elderly, patients in poor general condition (optimise patient's condition before major block), pregnancy.

	Indication: Parenteral nutrition

Dose: Adults: The nitrogen requirement for maintenance of body protein mass depends on the patient's condition (nutritional state and degree of metabolic stress). No or minor metabolic stress and normal nutritional state: 0.10-0.15 g nitrogen/kg/day, Moderate metabolic stress with or without malnutrition: 0.15-0.20 g nitrogen/kg/day, Severe catabolism as in burns, sepsis and trauma: up to 0.20-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day. The dosage range 0.10-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day corresponds to 15-35 ml amino acid IV/kg/day. In obese patients, the dose should be based on the estimated ideal weight. Depending upon patients requirements, 1000-2000 ml amino acid may be infused intravenously per 24 hours. It should be infused slowly, at rates 1.4-2.8 ml (30-60 drops) per minute. Infants and Children: In children and infants, the rate of infusion is 28-35 ml/kg body wt/day is recommended, with a stepwise increment in the rate of administration during the first week of treatment.

Contra-indication: contraindicated in patients with inborn errors of amino acids metabolism. Moreover, amino acid should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.

Side effects: It is usually well tolerated. Yet nausea, vomiting, flushing and sweating have been observed during infusion of amino acid IV at rates exceeding the recommended maximal rate. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Like all hypertonic infusion solution, thrombophlebitis may occur when peripheral veins are used. The incidence may be reduced by the simultaneous infusion of 10% fat emulsion. If it is infused to severely ill patients, premature infants, hyperphenylalaninemia may occur.

Precaution: Hyperphenylalaninemia has been noted in severely ill, premature infants. In these patients, monitoring of the phenylalanine levels is recommended and the infusion rate adjusted as needed. Do not use if the solution is turbid or contains particles. Discard any unused portion.

Mode of action: None

	Indication: Prevent nitrogen loss, Negative nitrogen balance, Nutritional therapy

Dose: For peripheral intravenous infusion, 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism. Infusion or ingestion of carbohydrate or lipid will not reduce the nitrogen sparing effect of intravenous amino acid infusions at this dose.
As with all intravenous fluid therapy, the primary aim is to provide sufficient water to compensate for insensible, urinary, and other fluid losses (nasogastric suction, fistula drainage, and diarrhea).  Infused at a rate of 45 mL/kg/day, will meet the fluid and amino acid requirements of the stable adult patient.
As reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia.

Contra-indication: This preparation should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.

Side effects:  it can be infused through a peripheral vein paying great care to the possible occurrence of local reactions. Local reactions consisting of a warm sensation, erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids; in such cases the infusion site should be changed promptly to another vein. Use of large peripheral veins, inline filters, and slower rates of infusion may reduce the incidence of local venous irritation. Electrolyte additives should be spread throughout the day. Irritating additive medications may need to be injected at another venous site.

Generalized flushing, fever and nausea have been reported during peripheral infusions of amino acid solutions.

Precaution: Special care must be taken when administering glucose solutions to provide calories in diabetic or prediabetic patients. To control and minimize possible hyperglycemia and consequent glycosuria, it is desirable to monitor blood and urine glucose and, if necessary, add insulin.

Because of its antianabolic activity, concurrent administration of tetracycline may reduce the nitrogen sparing effects of infused amino acids.

Feeding regimens which include amino acids should be used with caution in patients with history of renal disease, pulmonary disease, or with cardiac insufficiency so as to avoid excessive fluid accumulation.

Nitrogen intake should be carefully monitored in patients with impaired renal function.

	Indication: Mild to moderate hypertension, Chronic stable and vasospastic angina, Raynaud's disease, Coronary Artery Disease, HTN, Stroke prevention

Dose: Adult: PO Stable angina; HTN; Prinzmetal's angina Initial: 5 mg once daily;  If the desired therapeutic effect cannot be achieved within 2-4 weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. 

Child: >12 yr Initially, 2.5 mg once daily, increased to 5 mg once daily if necessary.
Elderly: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
Hepatic impairment: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to Amlodipine or other calcium channel antagonist, Severe hypertension.

Side effects: Headache, peripheral oedema, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, palpitations, dizziness. Rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia, muscle cramps.Potentially Fatal: Hypotension, bradycardia, conductive system delay and CCF.

Precaution: Impaired liver or renal function, CHF, sick-sinus syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis. Caution when used in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Elderly, children. Pregnancy, lactation.  Use in renal failure: Although Amlodipine is excreted primarily via kidney, mild renal impairment does not appear to have an effect on the plasma concentrations. Severe renal impairment may however require a dosage reduction. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Amlodipine half-life is prolonged in patient with impaired hepatic function. Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.

Mode of action: Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis.

Potentially Fatal: Acute renal failure.

Precaution: Drugs that act on renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal injury and death when used in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Olmesartan medoxomil should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. May be associated with oliguria, progressive azotaemia, and acute renal failure (rare). Patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis may have increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. Caution in renal impairment; monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels periodically. Avoid use in severe renal impairment (CrCl< 20 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment. Caution in patients with aortic or mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with primary aldosteronism may not respond to angiotensin receptor antagonist. Not recommended in lactation.

Mode of action: Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.
	Increased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ ACE inhibitors, K-sparing diuretics, K salts or K supplements and drugs that may increase serum K (e.g. ciclosporin, eplerenone). May potentiate BP lowering effects w/ other antihypertensives. May decrease glomerular filtration w/ NSAIDs which can cause acute renal failure. May increase serum concentrations and toxicity of lithium.

	Indication: Angina, Hyperlipidaemia, Hypertension, Stroke prevention

Dose: Adult: PO HTN or angina and hyperlipidaemia: 

 Amlodipine: Initially 5 mg once daily, titrate over 1-2 wk; max: 10 mg/day. Atorvastatin: Initially 10-20 mg once daily (anytime of the day), patients who require >45 % reduction in LDL cholesterol may be initiated at 40 mg once daily. Titrate dose at intervals of at least 4 week; max: 80 mg/day.

Contra-indication: Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevated hepatic transaminases. Pregnancy and lactation.

Side effects: Amlodipine: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, peripheral oedema, flushing, palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain; rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia and muscle cramps. Atorvastatin: Nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhoea, pain in extremity, UTI, dyspepsia, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasms, myalgia, insomnia, increased transaminases, abnormal liver function test, increased creatinine phosphokinase, thrombocytopenia, malaise, hepatitis, cholestasis, bullous rashes.
Potentially Fatal: Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.

Precaution: Atorvastatin may cause myopathy, and rarely rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria especially at high doses or in patients with history of renal impairment. Caution when used with CYP3A4 inhibitors which may increase plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin. Withhold/discontinue Atorvastatin if symptoms suggestive of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis are observed. Atorvastatin has been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver; LFT should be monitored prior to and at 12 wk following treatment initiation and dosage increment; caution in patients who consume large amounts of alcohol or with history of liver disease. Worsening of angina and/or myocardial infarction has been reported with use of dihydrophyridine calcium channel blockers, especially in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. Amlodipine may cause dose-dependent peripheral oedema. Caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Elderly.

Mode of action: Rifamycins may increase the metabolism of both Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin may increase AUC of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
Potentially Fatal: Atorvastatin: Increased risk of myopathy when used concurrently with fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, itraconazole). Cyclosporine (OATP1B1 inhibitor) may significantly increase bioavailability of Atorvastatin.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Rifamycins may increase the metabolism of both Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin may increase AUC of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
Potentially Fatal: Atorvastatin: Increased risk of myopathy when used concurrently with fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, itraconazole).

Dose: For oral administration only.
Reconstitution: The powder contents of one sachet or two effervescent tablets should be made up to 200ml with fresh drinking water. (For infants, the water should be freshly boiled and cooled before mixing with Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula). An infant's feeding bottle is a convenient measure of this volume. The solution should be made up immediately prior to feeding and any solution remaining an hour after reconstitution should be discarded. However, the solution may be used for up to 24 hours if stored in a refrigerator immediately after reconstitution. The reconstituted solution must not be boiled.

Contra-indication: There are no known contraindications to Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula. However, there may be a number of conditions where treatment with Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula will be inappropriate, e.g. intestinal obstruction requiring surgical intervention.

Side effects: None reported.

Precaution: Use water ONLY to mix Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula powder or effervescent tablets. Never dilute with lemonade, soft drinks, cordials or any other fluid than water.
Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula powder is available with either sodium saccharin or aspartame as a sweetening agent. Phenylketonurics are warned that this product, in some forms, contains phenylalanine. Please refer to the packaging for information relating to the sweetening agent used.
For oral administration only. The contents of one sachet or two effervescent tablets should always be made up to 200ml with water (the product must not be reconstituted in diluents other than water, e.g. must not be included in milk solutions). A weaker solution than recommended will fail to provide adequate sugar and electrolytes and a stronger solution than recommended may give rise to hypernatraemia. Intravenous rehydration is required for dehydrated children with shock, very large stool losses (>10mL/kg/hour), severe vomiting that interferes with oral fluid replacement, or glucose malabsorption. Patients with gastroenteritis should be monitored carefully to ensure that their condition does not deteriorate. In particular, young infants may become severely dehydrated in a short time.
Patients and/or parents should be advised to seek medical advice if the condition worsens. Clinicians should particularly ensure patients are aware of the risk of dehydration in young children and infants. Early warning signs of impending dehydration should be discussed.
Seek medical advice if diarrhoea persists for more than 6 hours in infants under 6 months, 12 hours in children aged 6 months to 3 years, 24 hours in children aged 3 to 6 years and 48 hours in children over 6 years of age.

Contra-indication: In individuals who have had an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to antihemophilic factor or von Willebrand factor preparations.

Side effects: The most serious adverse reaction observed in patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII is anaphylaxis. Thromboembolic events have also been observed in patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII for the treatment of VWD . Reports of thromboembolic events in VWD patients with other thrombotic risk factors receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy have been obtained from spontaneous reports, published literature, and a European clinical study. In some cases, inhibitors to coagulation factors may occur. However, no inhibitor formation was observed in any of the clinical studies.

In patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII in clinical studies for treatment of VWD, the most commonly reported adverse reactions observed by >5% of subjects are allergic-anaphylactic reactions (including urticaria, chest tightness, rash, pruritus, and edema). For patients undergoing surgery, the most common adverse reactions are postoperative wound and injection-site bleeding, and epistaxis.

Precaution: 5.1 Thromboembolic Events (VWD Patients)

Thromboembolic events have been reported in VWD patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor/von Willebrand Factor Complex replacement therapy, especially in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis.3,4 Early reports indicate a higher incidence may occur in females. Endogenous high levels of FVIII have also been associated with thrombosis, but no causal relationship has been established. Exercise caution and consider antithrombotic measures in all at-risk VWD patients who are receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy.

5.2 Monitoring for Intravascular Hemolysis

This contains blood group isoagglutinins (anti-A and anti-B). When doses are very large or need to be repeated frequently (for example, when inhibitors are present or when pre- and post-surgical care is involved), monitor patients of blood groups A, B, and AB for signs of intravascular hemolysis and decreasing hematocrit values and treat appropriately.

5.3 Monitoring VWF:RCo and FVIII Levels

Monitor the VWF: RCo and FVIII levels of VWD patients receiving this medicine using standard coagulation tests, especially in cases of surgery. It is advisable to monitor trough VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels at least once a day in order to adjust the dosage of this as needed to avoid excessive accumulation of coagulation factors

Contra-indication: Tachycardia, hypertension, cerebral arteriosclerosis, ischaemic heart disease, IV admin, anaesthetise digits or appendages, myasthenia gravis.

Side effects: Severity of adverse effects in CNS and CVS are directly related to blood levels of lidocaine; dizziness; muscle twitching; 
local anaesthetic of mouth/throat impairs swallowing and increases the risk of aspiration (patients cautioned against eating or drinking for 3-4 hr after anaesthesia); transient effect on auditory system of neonate; erythema; pigmentation; pain; headache; palpitations; local necrosis; pulmonary oedema; hyperglycaemia; bradycardia; reduced cardiac output; anxiety. 
Epidural may cause hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting. Intraoral inj may cause stress reactions such as diaphoresis, palpitation, hyperventilation, generalised pallor and faintness. 
Topically: papules, burns, rash, skin irritation, burning sensation and blanching.
Potentially Fatal: CNS toxicity (due to inadvertent IV admin), medullary depression with tonic & clonic convulsions; ventricular fibrillation; severe hypertension with cerebral haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema; unconsciousness; possibly respiratory arrest. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and possibly life threatening asthmatic episodes in susceptible patients may occur due to sodium metabisulphate constituent. Central nerve blocks may cause CV depression (especially in hypovolaemia). Retrobulbar inj may reach subarachnoid space causing CV collapse, apnoea, convulsions, temporary blindness. Paracervical block may cause foetal bradycardia/tachycardia (careful monitoring of foetal heart rate is necessary).

Precaution: Epilepsy, impaired cardiac conduction, CHF, DM, closed angle glaucoma, impaired liver function (if site of admin is likely to result in high blood levels), severe renal dysfunction. Local anaesthetic effect may be reduced if injected into an inflamed or infected area. Cerebrovascular insufficiency, hyperthyroidism. Neonates, elderly, patients in poor general condition (optimise patient's condition before major block), pregnancy.

Mode of action: The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonists, or tricyclic antidepressants may produce severe, prolonged hypertension. Phenothiazines and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of epinephrine. Concurrent use of these agents should be avoided; however, in situations when concurrent therapy is necessary, careful patient monitoring is essential.

	Indication:  Primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial), Mixed Dyslipidemia, Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, Hypertriglyceridemia, Familial hypercholesterolemia, Cardiovascular event prevention, Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia

Dose: Oral
Mixed dyslipidaemia, Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, Nonfamilial hypercholesterolaemia
Adult: Initially, 10 or 20 mg once daily, may be adjusted at 4-wk interval. May initiate 40 mg once daily in patients who require >45% reduction in LDL-cholesterol. Max: 80 mg/day.

Child: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: 10-17 yr 10 mg once daily, may increase at intervals of at least 4 wk to max 20 mg/day.
Elderly: No dosage adjustment needed.

Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. Therapy should be individualized according to goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of Atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the LDL-C levels should be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should total-C be used to monitor therapy. 

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage of Atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (eg, LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 

Dosage in Patients with Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary. 

Pediatric Use: Treatment experience in a pediatric population is limited to doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day for 1 year in 8 patients with homozygous FH. No clinical or biochemical abnormalities were reported in these patients. None of these patients was below 9 years of age. 

Geriatric Use: Treatment experience in adult’s age 70 years with doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day has been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of Atorvastatin in this population were similar to those of patients <70 years of age.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity, active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminase, porphyria, pregnancy, lactation.

Side effects: Headache, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, xerostomia, angioedema, myalgia, rash/pruritus, alopecia, allergy, infection, chest pain.Potentially Fatal: Thrombocytopenia. Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.

Precaution: Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. History of liver disease. Patients with risk factors for myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Hypothyroidism should be properly managed prior to starting statin therapy. Children <10 yr. Premenarcheal females.

Mode of action: May increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis w/ CYP3A4 potent inhibitor (e.g. HIV or HCV protease inhibitors, itraconazole, clarithromycin), fenofibrate, colchicines, fixed combination of lopinavir/ritonavir. May decrease plasma concentration w/ CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. rifampicin, efavirenz). May significantly increase AUC and peak plasma concentration of digoxin. Increased AUC for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
Potentially Fatal: Increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis w/ ciclosporin, gemfibrozil, telaprevir, tipranavir.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: May increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis w/ CYP3A4 potent inhibitor (e.g. HIV or HCV protease inhibitors, itraconazole, clarithromycin), fenofibrate, colchicines, fixed combination of lopinavir/ritonavir.

Adult: Initially, 300-600 mcg/kg as inj. Subsequently, 100-200 mcg/kg when necessary or every 15-25 minutes for maintenance in prolonged procedures. Alternatively, maintenance can also be achieved by continuous infusion at 5-10 mcg/kg/minute. Initial dose should be given over 60 seconds in patients with CV disease. Dose should be calculated based on ideal body-weight in obese patients.

Child: >2 mth: Initially, 400-500 mcg/kg as inj. Maintenance dose: 80-100 mcg/kg; first maintenance dose may be given 20-45 min after the initial dose, subsequently, may be repeated every 15-25 min. 

For children 1 mth-2 yr: 300-400 mcg/kg may be used as initial dose in those who are under halothane anaesthesia. Maintenance doses may be admin more frequently in infant and children than adults.

Special Populations: For patients with significant CV disease or any history (e.g. severe anaphylactoid reactions or asthma) suggesting a greater risk of histamine release, an initial dose of 0.3-0.4 mg/kg should be given slowly or in divided doses over 1 min. For adults receiving atracurium following the use of succinylcholine for intubation under balanced anesthesia, an initial dose of 0.3-0.4 mg/kg is recommended. Dosage reductions may be necessary in patients with neuromuscular disease, severe electrolyte disorders or carcinomatosis in which potentiation of neuromuscular block or difficulties with reversal have been demonstrated.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Cutaneous reactions; bradycardia, transient hypotension in patients with CVS disorders; dyspnoea, bronchospasm; rash and urticaria.

Precaution: Neonates; severe CVS disorders; renal or hepatic dysfunction; myasthenia gravis and other neuromuscular disorders; severe electrolyte imbalances; respiratory insufficiency or pulmonary disease, asthma; burns; cardiopulmonary bypass; smoking; pregnancy and lactation.

Dose to be given via intradermal inj. 

Intravesical
Immunotherapy of bladder cancer
Dosage: The content of 1 vial is required for 1 bladder instillation.
Duration: A standard treatment schedule consists of 1 intravesical instillation of BCG-Medac per week for 6 consecutive weeks as induction therapy. BCG treatment must not start until 2-3 weeks after transurethral resection (TUR). After a treatment-free interval of 4 weeks, intravesical administration should continue using maintenance therapy for at least 1 year. 

Induction Therapy (Prophylactic Treatment of Recurrence): BCG therapy should begin about 2-3 weeks after TUR or bladder biopsy, and without traumatic catheterisation, and be repeated at weekly intervals for 6 weeks. In intermediate and high-risk tumours, this should be followed by maintenance therapy.

Maintenance Therapy: One schedule consists of a 12-month therapy with treatments at monthly intervals. Another maintenance scheme consists of 3 instillations at weekly intervals at month 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36. In this scheme, a total of 27 instillations are administered during a period of 3 years.

Administration: BCG-Medac should be administered in the conditions required for intravesical endoscopy.  The bladder must be emptied before BCG instillation. BCG-Medac is introduced into the bladder by means of a catheter and at low pressure. 


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of BCG-Medac.
BCG-Medac should not be used in immunosuppressed patients or persons with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, whether due to concurrent disease (eg, positive HIV serology, leukaemia, lymphoma), cancer therapy (eg, cytostatic drugs, radiation) or immunosuppressive therapy (eg, corticosteroids).
BCG-Medac should not be administered to persons with active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis should be ruled out in individuals by anamnesis.
Past history of radiotherapy of the bladder.
BCG-Medac must not be instilled before 2-3 weeks after a TUR, a bladder biopsy or a traumatic catheterisation. Perforation of the bladder. Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) (see Precautions).
Use in lactation: There are no adequate data from the excretion of these bacteria in breastmilk. This treatment is contraindicated in nursing women.

Side effects: Side effects of BCG treatment are frequent but generally mild and transient. Adverse reactions usually increase with the number of BCG instillations.
In uncommon cases of arthritis/arthralgias, skin rash may occur. In most cases of arthritis, arthralgias and skin rash, these can be attributed to hypersensitivity reactions of the patient to BCG. It may be necessary in some cases to discontinue the administration of BCG-Medac.
Local Adverse Reactions: Discomfort and pain when urinating and frequent urination occur in up to 90% of the patients. The cystitis and inflammatory reaction (granulomata) may be an essential part of the antitumour activity.
Further local side effects which are uncommonly observed: Macroscopic haematuria, UTI, bladder retraction, urinary obstruction, bladder contracture, symptomatic granulomatous prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis. Renal abscess is rarely observed. Furthermore, genital disorders (eg, vaginal pain, dyspareunia) may occur with an unknown frequency.
Transient Systemic BCG Reaction: Low grade fever, flu-like symptoms and general discomfort may occur. These symptoms usually subside within 24-48 hrs and should be managed by standard symptomatic treatment. These reactions are signs of a starting immune reaction. All patients receiving BCG-Medac should be carefully monitored and advised to report all incidences of fever and other events outside the urinary tract.
Severe Systemic Adverse Reactions/Infections: Systemic adverse reactions/infections are defined as: Fever >39.5°C during at least 12 hrs, fever >38.5°C during at least 48 hrs, miliary pneumonia due to BCG, granulomatous hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, organic dysfunction (other than genitourinary tract) with granulomatous inflammation at biopsy, Reiter's syndrome. Severe systemic BCG reaction/infection can lead to BCG sepsis which is a life-threatening situation.

Precaution: BCG-Medac may not be used for SC, intradermal, IM or IV administration or vaccination.
Treatment of Symptoms, Signs or Syndrome: See Adverse Reactions.
Number of BCG instillations: Side effects of BCG-treatment are frequent but generally mild and transient. Adverse reactions usually increase with the number of BCG instillations.
Severe Systemic BCG Infection/Reaction: Systemic BCG infections/reactions have been rarely reported and are described as fever >39.5°C during at least 12 hrs, fever >38.5°C during at least 48 hrs, miliary pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, organic dysfunction (other than genitourinary tract) with granulomatous inflammation at biopsy. Reiter's syndrome. The possibility of severe systemic BCG infections has to be considered before starting the therapy.

Mode of action: Concurrent use with antimicrobials may interfere with efficacy of intravesicular BCG and suppress the immune response to BCG vaccination. Immune globulins may reduce the therapeutic effect of live organism vaccines. Increased risk of infections associated with vaccines (live organism) when used with immunosuppressants. Immune response of BCG vaccination may be compromised when used within 30 days of another live organism vaccine.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Concurrent use with antimicrobials may interfere with efficacy of intravesicular BCG and suppress the immune response to BCG vaccination. Immune globulins may reduce the therapeutic effect of live organism vaccines. Increased risk of infections associated with vaccines (live organism) when used with immunosuppressants. Immune response of BCG vaccination may be compromised when used within 30 days of another live organism vaccine.Bio Pharma Ltd.	Nuba Plus Ointment   10gm  tube 30.11

	Indication: Minor cuts, Scrapes, Burns, Eczematoid dermatitis, Neurodermatitis, Eczema, Anogenital pruritus, Impetigo, Contact dermatitis, Bacterial skin infections

Dose: Apply the ointment in the affected eye every 3 or 4 hours, depending on the severity of the condition. Not more than 8 grams should be prescribed initially and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in precaution above.

Contra-indication: Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate ophthalmic ointment is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including: epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate ophthalmic ointment is also contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components. Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components.

Side effects: Adverse reactions have occurred with corticosteroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the corticosteroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. The exact incidence is not known. Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredient are allergic sensitization reactions including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . 

More serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. The reactions due to the corticosteroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.

Secondary Infection: The development of the secondary ocular infection has occurred after use of combinations containing corticosteroids and antimicrobials. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of a corticosteroid. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where corticosteroid treatment has been used . Local irritation on installation has been reported.

Precaution:  The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 8 grams should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. 

As fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term corticosteroid applications, fungal invasion should be suspected in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. 

There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of topical ophthalmic products in multiple-dose containers which have been inadvertently contaminated by patients, most of whom had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. 

Allergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.

	Indication: X-ray imaging,Diagnostic procedures,Imaging of the GI tract

Dose: It  will depend on the degree and extent of contrast required in the area(s) under examination and on the equipment and technique employed.

Contra-indication: This product should not be used in patients with known gastric or intestinal perforation or hypersensitivity to barium sulfate products.

Side effects: Adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping, accompanying the use of barium sulfate formulations are infrequent and usually mild. Severe reactions (approximately 1 in 1,000,000) and fatalities (approximately 1 in 10,000,000) have occurred. Procedural complications are rare, but may include aspiration pneumonitis, barium sulfate impaction, granuloma formation, intravasation, embolization and peritonitis following intestinal perforation, vasovagal and syncopal episodes, and fatalities. It is of the utmost importance to be completely prepared to treat any such occurrence.

Precaution: Diagnostic procedures which involve the use of radiopaque contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel with the requisite training and with a thorough knowledge of the particular procedure to be performed. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, as evidenced by hay fever and eczema, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent, warrant special attention. Caution should be exercised with the use of radiopaque media in severely debilitated patients and in those with marked hypertension or advanced cardiac disease.

Ingestion of this product is not recommended in patients with a history of food aspiration. If barium studies are required in these patients or in patients in whom integrity of the swallowing mechanism is unknown, proceed with caution. If this product is aspirated into the larynx, further administration should be immediately discontinued.

After any barium study of the GI tract, it is important to rehydrate the patient as quickly as possible to prevent impaction of the bowel by barium sulfate. To prevent barium sulfate impaction in the bowel, the use of mild laxatives such as milk of magnesia or lactulose, following completion of the examination may also be required. These mild laxatives are recommended on a routine basis and in patients with a history of constipation unless contraindicated.

Use with caution in patients with complete or nearly complete obstruction of the GI tract.

Dose: Gently massage sufficient Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream into the affected skin areas twice a day, in the morning and evening.

Contra-indication: Patients who are sensitive to clotrimazole, betamethasone dipropionate, other corticosteroids or imidazoles, or to any ingredient in these preparations.

Side effects: Adverse reactions reported for Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream in clinical trials were paresthesia in 1.9% of patients, and rash, edema, and secondary infection, each in less than 1% of patients.

The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids and may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings. 
In the pediatric population, reported adverse events for Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream include growth retardation, benign intracranial hypertension, Cushing's syndrome (HPA axis suppression), and local cutaneous reactions, including skin atrophy.

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.

Adverse reactions reported with the use of clotrimazole are as follows: erythema, stinging, blistering, peeling, edema, pruritus, urticaria, and general irritation of the skin.

Precaution: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and use under occlusive dressings. 

If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios

Dose: The appropriate dose of black seed depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for black seed. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using.

Contra-indication: Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.

Side effects: Black seed, when used in small quantities, such as a flavoring for foods, appears to be safe for most people. There isn't enough information to know if larger, medicinal quantities are safe. Black seed can cause allergic rashes when applied to the skin. 

Precaution: Black seed seems to be safe in food amounts during pregnancy. But taking larger medicinal amounts is UNSAFE. Black seed can slow down or stop the uterus from contracting.

Interaction:Unimed & Unihealth Manufacturers Ltd.	Pulmoten TAB dr 62.5mg 7's pack
 1050
	Indication: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)

Dose: Adult Dosage:
Initiate treatment at 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then increase to the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily. Doses above 125 mg twice daily did not appear to confer additional benefit sufficient to offset the increased risk of hepatotoxicity.

Bosentan should be administered in the morning and evening with or without food.

Contra-indication: Patients with WHO Class II symptoms showed reduction in the rate of clinical deterioration and a trend for improvement in walk distance. Physicians should consider whether these benefits are sufficient to offset the risk of hepatotoxicity in WHO Class II patients, which may preclude future use as their disease progresses.

Side effects: More common

    Blurred vision
    confusion
    dizziness
    dark urine
    faintness or lightheadedness when getting up from a lying or sitting position
    fever with or without chills
    light-colored stools
    loss of appetite
    nausea and vomiting
    stomach pain
    sudden sweating
    unusual tiredness or weakness
    yellow eyes or skin


Precaution: Hepatotoxicity and teratogenicity. Elevations of AST or ALT associated with Bosentan are dose-dependent, occur both early and late in treatment, usually progress slowly, are typically asymptomatic, and usually have been reversible after treatment interruption or cessation. Aminotransferase elevations also may reverse spontaneously while continuing treatment with Tracleer.

Liver aminotransferase levels must be measured prior to initiation of treatment and then monthly and therapy adjusted accordingly .Discontinue Bosentan if liver aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity (such as nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, or unusual lethargy or fatigue) or increases in bilirubin > 2 

Mode of action: Increased bosentan levels w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir, diltiazem), CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. amiodarone, fluconazole), tacrolimus. Rifampicin initially increases but subsequently decreases bosentan concentration. May decrease plasma levels of warfarin, statins (e.g. simvastatin, lovastatin), hormonal contraceptives, sildenafil, tadalafil.
Potentially Fatal: Increased risk of hepatotoxicity may occur w/ glibenclamide. Ciclosporin markedly increases bosentan concentration.

Contra-indication: Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma. Hypersensitivity to Budesonide, Formoterol or to Lactose.

Side effects: The most common drug related adverse reactions are pharmacologically predictable side effects of beta 2-agonist therapy, such as tremor and palpitations. Adverse events which have been associated with Budesonide and Formoterol are Palpitations, Candida infections in oropharynx, Headache, Tremor, Coughing, Hoarseness and Tachycardia.

Precaution: Treatment with Budesonide and Formoterol combination should not be initiated to treat a severe exacerbation or if patients have significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. May produce paradoxical bronchospasm which is life-threatening. Caution when used in patients with CV diseases, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Chronic use may further decrease bone mineral content when used in patients with advanced age, osteoporosis, poor nutrition, sedentary lifestyle or tobacco use. May reduce growth velocity when used in paediatric patients. Caution when used in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract, untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Concomitant admin with CYP3A4 inhibitor e.g. itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin may inhibit the metabolism of budesonide. Concurrent use with nonpotassium-sparing diuretics may lead to ECG changes and/or hypokalaemia.

Max: 450 mg as a single dose.

Contra-indication: It is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder. Bupropion Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients treated with other medications that contain Bupropion because the incidence of seizure is
dose dependent. Bupropion may induce seizure and consequently its use is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy. The drug is also contraindicated in patients with a current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or
anorexia nervosa because of a higher incidence of seizures noted in such patients treated for bulimia with Bupropion Hydrochloride. The concurrent administration of Bupropion Hydrochloride and
a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of MAO inhibitor and initiation of treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride. Bupropion Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown an allergic response to
Bupropion or the other ingredients that make up Bupropion Hydrochloride.

Side effects: Agitation, anxiety, and insomnia often occur during the initial stages of Bupropion therapy. Other relatively common side effects reported with Bupropion include fever, dry mouth, headache or migraine, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, tremor, sweating, and skin rashes.
Hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from pruritus and urticaria, less commonly, angio-oedema, dyspnoea, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.

Precaution: It should be used with extreme caution, in patients with history of seizure disorders or in patients with other predisposing factors such as severe hepatic cirrhosis or a CNS tumour, and in those undergoing abrupt withdrawal from alcohol or Benzodiazepines. The use of Bupropion in patients with other risk factors for seizures (for example, alcohol abuse, a history of head trauma, diabetes, and drugs known to lower the seizure threshold) should only be undertaken when there are compelling clinical
reasons. Bupropion should be used with caution in patients with bipolar depression or psychoses and in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease and in hepatic or renal
impairment. 

Mode of action: Neuroleptics, lithium and TCAs, benzodiazepine, alcohol, drugs that lower seizure threshold. Increased risk of side effects when co-admin with levodopa. Reduced hepatic clearance with fluoxetine. Caution when administering with agents that will affect hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. Increased risk of toxicity when used with ritonavir.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAO inhibitors may cause acute toxicity symptoms and increased risk of fatality.

	Indication: Osteoporosis, Hypoparathyroidism, Hypocalcaemia, Osteomalacia rickets, Renal osteodystrophy, Chronic kidney dialysis.

Dose:  Adult: Capsule: The optimal daily dose of Calcitriol must be carefully determined for each patient on the basis of the serum calcium level. Calcitriol  can be administered orally either 0.25 mcg or 0.50 mcg.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis
The recommended dosage is 0.25 mcg twice daily or 0.50 mcg once daily. Serum creatinine levels should be determined at 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months and 6 monthly intervals thereafter.

Renal osteodystrophy (Dialysis patients)
The recommended initial dose of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day. Patients with normal or only slightly reduced serum calcium levels may respond to Calcitriol doses of 0.25 mcg every other day. Most patients undergoing hemodialysis respond to doses between 0.5 and 1 mcg/day.

Hypoparathyroidism & Rickets
The recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day given in the morning. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased at 2 to 4 week intervals.

Predialysis patients:
The recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day in adults and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. This dosage may be increased if necessary to 0.5 mcg/day.
Child dose: 1 month - 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 10 to 15 ng/kg/day.

Injection
The recommended intravenous initial dose of Calcitriol injection, depending on the severity of the hypocalcemia and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism, is 1 mcg (0.02 mcg/kg) to 2 mcg administered three times weekly, approximately every other day. Doses as small as 0.5 mcg and as large as 4 mcg three times weekly have been used as an initial dose. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 1 mcg at two to four week intervals. 

Contra-indication: Hypercalcaemia; evidence of vitamin D toxicity. Pregnancy (dose exceeding RDA). Lactation.

Side effects: Adverse events associated with Calcitriol therapy are similar to those encountered with excess vitamin D intake, i.e. hypercalcemia syndrome, or calcium intoxication.

Occasional acute symptoms include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or stomach ache and constipation.

Precaution: Idiopathic hypercalcaemia. Pediatric doses must be individualised and monitored under close medical supervision. Coronary disease, renal function impairment and arteriosclerosis, especially in the elderly. Hypoparathyroidism.
Excessive dosage of Calcitriol induces hypercalcemia and in some instances hypercalciuria; therefore, early in treatment during dosage adjustment, serum calcium should be determined twice weekly. 
Patients with normal renal function who are taking Calcitriol should avoid dehydration. Adequate fluid intake should be maintained.

Mode of action: Hypermagnesaemia may develop in patients on chronic renal dialysis. Hypercalcaemia in patients on digitalis may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. Intestinal absorption of calcitriol may be reduced by cholestyramine and colestipol. Phenytoin, barbiturates may decrease the T1/2 of calcitriol. May develop hypercalcaemia with thiazide diuretics.

Contra-indication: Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.

Side effects: Mild and transient effects of gastrointestinal disturbances, like constipation, flatulence, nausea, diarrhoea may be seen in some individuals. Following administration of vitamin D supplements may cause skin rash in some rare cases. Hypercalciuria have been seen with long term use at high dosage.

Precaution: Patients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild hypercalciuria should be supervised carefully. Periodic checks of plasma calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion should be made in patients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild hypercalciuria. 

Urinary calcium excretion should also be measured. In patients with a history of renal stones urinary calcium excretion should be measured to exclude hypercalciuria. With long-term treatment it is advisable to monitor serum and urinary calcium levels and kidney function, and reduce or stop treatment temporarily if urinary calcium exceeds 7.5mmol/24 hours. 

Mode of action: May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D, monitor ECG and serum calcium levels.

Side effects: Constipation, flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, pruritus, rash and urticaria.

Precaution: Impaired calcium absorption in achlorhydria which is common in elderly. Increased risk of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria in hypoparathyroid patients receiving high doses of vitamin D. Caution when using in patients with history of kidney stones. Renal impairment; frequent monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus is recommended.

Mode of action: May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D, monitor ECG and serum calcium levels. Bisphosphonate or sodium fluoride should be given at least 3 hr before calcium-containing preparations.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D, monitor ECG and serum calcium levels. Bisphosphonate or sodium fluoride should be given at least 3 hr before calcium-containing preparations.Square	Calbo-D Vita TAB dr 600 mg + 400 IU  150

Precaution: When hypercalcemia occurs discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to return serum calcium concentrations to normal. Calcium salts should be used cautiously in patients with sarcoidosis, renal or cardiac disease and in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. Patients with a history of stone formation should also be recommended to increase their fluid intake.

Mode of action: May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D.

Precaution: Causes intravascular volume contraction and symptomatic hypotension can occur, particularly if eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²2, advance age, existing low systolic BP, or taking either diuretics or drugs that interfere with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) (eg, ACE inhibitors, ARBs).

Drug increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR, patients with hypovolemia are more susceptible to renal function impairment.

Hyperkalemia reported; patients with moderate renal impairment who take potassium-sparing diuretics or drugs that alter RAS are more likely to develop hyperkalemia.

Hypoglycemia risk increased with insulin and insulin secretagogues, adjust dose.

Genital mycotic infections may occur, patients with history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males are more susceptible.

Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, generalized urticaria), some serious, were reported during clinical trials.

Dose-related increases in LDL-C reported.

No conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with canagliflozin or any other antidiabetic agent.

SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests; use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.

The FDA continues to investigate reports of ketoacidosis associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (ie, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin); monitor for signs of ketoacidosis and advise patients to seek immediate medical attention for symptoms (eg, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepiness).

Increased risk of bone fracture, occurring as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation, reported; consider factors that contribute to fracture risk prior to initiating therapy.

Higher risk of falls for patients treated within first few weeks of treatment reported.

	Indication: Epilepsy,Schizophrenia,Bipolar disorder,Trigeminal neuralgia

Dose: Epilepsy: Adults and children over 12 years of age - Initial: Either 200 mg b.i.d. for tablets and XR tablets, or 1 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (400 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a b.i.d or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the either formulations until the optimal response is obtained. 

Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily in children 12-15 years of age, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances. 

Maintenance: usually 800-1200 mg daily. Children 6-12 years of age - Initial: Either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or XR tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (200 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 100 mg/day using a b.i.d. or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the either formulations until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily. Maintenance: usually 400-800 mg daily. 

Children under 6 years of age - Initial: 10-20 mg/kg/day b.i.d. or t.i.d. as tablets, or q.i.d. as suspension. Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of Carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made. 

Combination therapy: Carbamazepine may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased. 

Trigeminal Neuralgia: Initial: On the first day, either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or XR tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours for tablets or XR tablets, or 50 mg (1/2 teaspoon) q.i.d. for suspension, only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. A total dose of 1200 mg daily shouldn't be exceeded. 
Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400-800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug. The tablets or syrup can be taken without regards to meal.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.

Side effects: Pain at inj site; hypersensitivity; GI disturbances; eosinophilia, neutropenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions; nephrotoxicity.

Precaution: Hypersensitivity to penicillins; pseudomembranous colitis; renal failure; pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Concurrent use w/ metfromin may result to fatal lactic acidosis. May enhance the anticoagulant effect of vit K antagonists (e.g. warfarin). Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ potent diuretics (e.g. ethacrynic acid, furosemide) and other potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics (e.g. aminoglycosides, polymyxin, colistin). Prothrombin time may be prolonged when used concomitantly w/ oral anticoagulants. May reduce the effects of OCs. Hypokalaemia may result from concomitant use of cefalexin and cytotoxic drugs for leukaemia. Uricosuric drugs (e.g. probenecid) may suppress renal excretion, resulting to increased plasma levels of cefalexin. May diminish the therapeutic effect of Na picosulfate, BCG and typhoid vaccine. May reduce serum level w/ multivitamins/minerals.

Pregnancy category: B

Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ potent diuretics (e.g. ethacrynic acid, furosemide) and other potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics (e.g. aminoglycosides, polymyxin, colistin). Prothrombin time may be prolonged when used concomitantly w/ oral anticoagulants. May reduce the effects of OCs. Hypokalaemia may result from concomitant use of cefalexin and cytotoxic drugs for leukaemia. Uricosuric drugs (e.g. probenecid) may suppress renal excretion, resulting to increased plasma levels of cefalexin. May diminish the therapeutic effect of Na picosulfate, BCG and typhoid vaccine. May reduce serum level w/ multivitamins/minerals.ACI	Avlosef Paediatric Drops 125mg/1.2ml 15ml bot 50.19

Contra-indication: Do not use in patients with known hypersensitivity to phenothiazines.

Do not use in comatose states or in the presence of large amounts of central nervous system depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, etc.).

Side effects: Note: Some adverse effects of chlorpromazine may be more likely to occur, or occur with greater intensity, in patients with special medical problems, e.g., patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses.

Precaution: Some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia,

Chlorpromazine should be administered cautiously to persons with cardiovascular, liver or renal disease. There is evidence that patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis have increased sensitivity to the CNS effects of chlorpromazine (i.e., impaired cerebration and abnormal slowing of the EEG).

Because of its CNS depressant effect, chlorpromazine should be used with caution in patients with chronic respiratory disorders such as severe asthma, emphysema and acute respiratory infections, particularly in children (1 to 12 years of age).

Because chlorpromazine can suppress the cough reflex, aspiration of vomitus is possible.

Mode of action: Potentiation of anticholinergic effects of antiparkinson agents and TCAs may lead to an anticholinergic crisis. Additive orthostatic hypotensive effect in combination with MAOIs. Reverses antihypertensive effect of guanethidine, methyldopa and clonidine.

	Indication: Osteoporosis, Hypoparathyroidism, Rickets, Osteomalacia,Vitamin D Deficiency, Pseudohypoparathyroidism, Familial hypophosphatemia

Dose: Oral /IM solution:
Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) is recommended 5-10 mcg or 1-2ml (200-400 IU)/day or as directed by the physician.

May also be given via IM inj.

Contra-indication: Colecalciferol is contraindicated in all diseases associated with hypercalcaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Colecalciferol (or medicines of the same class) and any of the constituent excipients. Colecalciferol is contraindicated if there is evidence of vitamin D toxicity.

Side effects: Generally all nutritional supplements are considered to be safe and well tolerable. However, few side-effects can generally occur including hypercalcaemia syndrome or Calcium intoxication (depending on the severity and duration of hypercalcaemia), occasional acute symptoms include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or stomach ache and constipation with the administration of Colecaciferol.

Precaution: People with the following conditions should exercise caution when considering taking vitamin D supplements:
High blood Calcium or Phosphorus level
Heart problems
Kidney disease

Vitamin D must be taken with adequate amounts of both Calcium and Magnesium supplementation. When Calcium level is low (due to insufficient vitamin D and calcium intake), the body activates the parathyroid gland, which produces PTH (parathyroid hormone). This hormone kick starts vitamin D hormone production and assists removal of Calcium from the bones to be used in more important functions such as neutralizing body acidity.

Mode of action: Increased risk of hypercalcaemia if given with thiazide diuretics, calcium or phosphate. Antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin & primidone) may increase vitamin D requirements. Rifampicin & isoniazid may reduce efficacy of vitamin D. Corticosteroids may counteract the effect of vitamin D. Digoxin or any cardiac glycoside. Reduced absorption when taken with cholestyramine, colestipol, mineral oil, orlistat. Ketoconazole.

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: Increased risk of hypercalcaemia if given with thiazide diuretics, calcium or phosphate.

Potentially Fatal: Hypersensitivity reaction including angioedema.

Precaution: Moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment, CV diseases. Not indicated for chronic kidney disease patients who are not receiving dialysis. Do not initiate Cinacalcet in hypocalcaemic patients. For secondary hyperparathyroidism, measure serum calcium and phosphorus (prior to- and within 1 wk after initiation/dose adjustment; mthly during maintenance) and iPTH (prior to- and within 1-4 wk after initiation/dosage adjustment; every 1-3 mth during maintenance). iPTH levels should drawn at least 12 hr after Cinacalcet dosing. 

For parathyroid carcinoma and primary parathyroidism, measure serum calcium prior-to and within 1 wk after initiation/dose adjustment; and every 2-3 mth during maintenance. Vitamin D sterols, calcium-containing phosphate binder and/or adjustment of calcium contents of dialysis fluid can be used to raise serum calcium in the event of hypocalcaemia. Reduce dose or withhold therapy if hypocalcaemia persists; may reinstate treatment at the next lowest dose after calcium levels normalised. Significant reduction in serum calcium may lower seizure threshold. Adynamic bone disease may develop if iPTH level is suppressed to < 100 pg/mL. May decrease total and free testosterone levels.

Dose: To relieve discomfort in UTI:
Adults & children over 6 years: 10 ml 3 times daily, diluted with 1 glass of water.
Children 1-6 years: 5 ml 3 times daily, diluted with 1/2 glass of water.

To prevent kidney stones, acidosis caused by kidney diseases, with uricosuric agent to prevent gout:
Adults: 10-15 ml 4 times daily; or as directed by the physician, diluted with 1 glass of water.
Pediatric: 5-10ml 4 times daily; or as directed by the physician, diluted with 1/2 glass of water.

Contra-indication: The drug is contraindicated in severe renal impairment with oliguria or azotemia, untreated Addison's disease, acute dehydration, severe myocardial damage, and hyperkalemia from any cause.

Side effects: This solution is generally well tolerated without any unpleasant side effect when given in recommended doses to patients with normal renal function and urinary output. However, as with any alkalinizing agent, caution must be used in certain patients with abnormal renal mechanisms to avoid development of hyperkalemia or alkalosis. Potassium intoxication causes listlessness, weakness, mental confusion, tingling of extremities, and other symptoms associated with a high concentration of potassium in the serum. 

Precaution: The solution should be used with caution in patients with low urinary output. It should be diluted adequately with water to minimize the possibility of gastrointestinal injury associated with the oral ingestion of concentrated potassium salt preparations; and preferably, to take each dose after meals. Large doses may cause hyperkalemia and alkalosis, especially in the presence of renal disease.

Dose: One strip lansoprazole, 30 mg; clarithromycin, 500 mg; and metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 7-14 days or as per the physicians advice. 

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to any component. Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin should not be given to patients with history of QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes. 

Side effects: Adverse reactions which were reported as possibly or probably related to treatment (<3%) in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly are listed below and divided by body systems. Digestive system : nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dark stool, glossitis, oral moniliasis, stomatitis, tongue discoloration, Musculoskeletal System : myalgia, Nervous System : confusion, headache, dizziness, Skin : skin reactions, Urological System : vaginitis, vaginal moniliasis. 

Precaution: Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy, including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:Indication: Leprosy

Dose: Adult: PO Multibacillary leprosy 300 mg (w/ rifampicin 600 mg) once mthly combined w/ 50 mg (w/ dapsone 100 mg) daily for 12 mth. Erythema nodosum leprosum (Type 2) Treatment depends on severity. 100-200 mg/day for up to 3 mth. Doses >200 mg/day are not recommended. Gradually taper the dose to 100 mg/day as soon as the reactive episode is controlled. Dapsone-resistant leprosy 100 mg/day w/ 1 or more other antileprosy drugs for 3 yr, then continue as a monotherapy at 100 mg/day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity. Lactation.

Side effects: Red-brownish black discolouration of skin especially areas exposed to sunlight, hair, sweat, sputum, urine, faeces. Rash, pruritus, photosensitivity, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, taste disorders, dryness of the skin, ichthyosis, decreased tear and sweat production.
Potentially Fatal: Crystal depletion in the wall of small bowel mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Severe abdominal symptoms including bowel obstruction, GI bleeding and splenic infarction.

Precaution: Pregnancy. Patients with GI symptoms.

Mode of action: Dapsone
Concomitant use of dapsone and clofazimine does not have a clinically important effect on dapsone pharmacokinetics.
Some evidence suggests dapsone may decrease or nullify some anti-inflammatory effects of clofazimine and theoretically might adversely affect clofazimine’s efficacy in patients with ENL reactions; several borderline leprosy and lepromatous leprosy patients with severe, recurrent ENL reactions reportedly required higher clofazimine dosage to control these reactions when dapsone therapy was given concomitantly than when clofazimine was given alone.

Isoniazid
Possible increased clofazimine plasma and urine concentrations and decreased clofazimine skin concentrations.

Rifampin
Although one study indicated that concomitant use of clofazimine in leprosy patients receiving rifampin alone or in conjunction with dapsone may decrease plasma concentrations and AUC of rifampin, concomitant use of clofazimine in another study in lepromatous leprosy patients receiving dapsone (100 mg daily) and rifampin (600 mg daily) did not affect rifampin pharmacokinetics.

Dose: In adult PTPs, on average, one international unit of coagulation factor ix recombinant per kilogram of body weight increased the circulating activity of factor IX by 0.8 ± 0.2 (range 0.4 to 1.4) IU/dL. 

In pediatric patients, on average, one international unit of coagulation factor ix recombinant per kilogram of body weight increased the circulating activity of factor IX by 0.7 ± 0.3 (range 0.2 to 2.1 IU/dL; median of 0.6 IU/dL per IU/kg). 

Contra-indication:  patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to hamster protein.

Side effects:     fever or chills;
    continued bleeding after treatment;
    feeling like you might pass out;
    sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body;
    sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; or
    swelling in your feet or ankles, weight gain, loss of appetite.

Less serious side effects may be more likely to occur, such as:

    headache;
    warmth, redness, or tingly feeling under your skin;
    nausea, vomiting;
    dizziness; or
    pain, redness, or swelling where the medicine was injected.

Precaution: Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) have been detected in patients receiving factor IXcontaining products. As with all factor IX products, patients using  (coagulation factor ix recombinant) should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors . Patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis upon subsequent challenge with factor IX.

 Patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of inhibitor. Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions. 

Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product. In view of the potential for allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial (approximately 10 - 20) administrations of factor IX should be performed under medical supervision where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.

Side effects: Hypertension; hepatoxicity; tremor; paraesthesia, hypertrichosis, facial oedema, acne; gingival hypertrophy; hyperkalaemia, fluid retention; increased susceptibility to infections; GI symptoms. Potentially Fatal: Nephrotoxicity; convulsions.

Precaution:  Cyclosporine increases the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. So patients should be warned to avoid excess ultraviolet light exposure. Cyclosporine may develop bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral infections. So therapeutic strategies should be employed for long-term immunosuppressive therapy. A reversible increase in serum creatinine and urea may occur during the first few weeks of Cyclosporine therapy and usually responding to dose reduction. In elderly patients, renal function should be monitored with particular care. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is required during Cyclosporine therapy; if hypertension develops, appropriate antihypertensive treatment must be instituted.  Cyclosporine enhances the risk of hyperkalaemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Caution is also required when Cyclosporine is co-administered with potassium sparing drugs. Cyclosporine enhances the clearance of magnesium. If considered necessary, magnesium supplementation should be given. Caution should be observed in treating patients with hyperuricaemia. During treatment with Cyclosporine, vaccination may be less effective; the use of live-attenuated vaccines should be avoided. Non-transplant patients with impaired renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled infections, or any kind of malignancy should not receive Cyclosporine. Renal and hepatic impairment; hyperuricaemia; anaphylaxis; history of allergic reactions; pregnancy; monitor BP, serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function.

	Indication: Endometriosis, Benign breast disorders, Gynaecomastia, Hereditary angioedema, Menorrhagia.

Dose: Adult: PO: 200-800 mg/day in 2 divided doses for 3-6 mth, up to 9 mth if needed. It is recommended that danazol therapy in adult females should start on the first day of the menstrual cycle with an adjustment of dosage made subsequently to achieve amenorrhoea or the desired effect.  

In endometrosis : The initial dose is 400 mg daily usually continued for 6 months. If symptoms do not resolve, the dose can be increased to 800 mg daily but the total course should not exceed 9 months.  

Benign breast disease: Severe cyclical mastalgia. The recommended initial dose for severe cyclical mastalgia is 200-300 mg daily for 3-6 month. In several studies, the initial dose was either 200 mg or 300 mg daily, which was reduced after either 1 or 2 months if a clinically useful response had occurred.  

Benign, multiple or recurrent breast disease: The recommended initial dose for this indication is 300 mg daily for 3-6 months.  

Menorrhagia: In menorrhagia, daily doses of 100-200 mg have been found effective but 200 mg daily is usually sufficient to reduce menstrual blood flow to acceptable levels. The recommended initial dose is 200 mg daily for 3 months.  

Gynecomastia: Adults, 300-600 mg daily. Adolescents, 200-300 mg daily.  

Preoperative thinning of the endometrium before hysteroscopic endometrial ablation: Danazol induces endometrial atrophy and is currently recommended at doses of 400-800 mg daily for up to 3 months preoperatively.

Dose: Recommended Starting Dose: 30 mg, taken as needed approximately 1-3 hrs prior to sexual activity.
Maximum Recommended Dosing Frequency: Once every 24 hrs. If the effect of 30 mg is insufficient and the side effects are acceptable, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg.

Elderly (>65 years): Safety and efficacy of Dapoxetine have not been established in patients >65 years as limited data are available in this population.

Children and Adolescents: Dapoxetine should not be used in individuals <18 years.

Patients with Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is required but caution is advised in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Dapoxetine is not recommended for use in the patients with severe renal impairment.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Dapoxetine is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.

Before treatment is initiated, the physician should obtain a careful medical history focusing on past orthostatic events and also perform an orthostatic test (blood pressure and pulse rate, supine and standing). If the patient discloses a history suggestive of orthostatic reactions or an orthostatic test shows this kind of reaction, treatment with Dapoxetine should be avoided.

Contra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to dapoxetine HCl or to any of the excipients.
Patients with significant pathological cardiac conditions [eg, heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), conduction abnormalities (2nd- or 3rd-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome) not treated with a permanent pacemaker, significant ischemic heart disease or significant valvular disease].
Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI. Similarly, a MAOI should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.

Concomitant treatment with thioridazine, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with thioridazine. Similarly, thioridazine should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.

Concomitant treatment with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)] or other medicinal/herbal products with serotonergic effects or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with these medicinal/herbal products. Similarly these medicinal/herbal products should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.

Side effects: Syncope characterized as loss of consciousness has been reported.The majority of cases occurred during the first 3 hrs after dosing, after the 1st dose or associated with study-related procedures in the clinic setting (eg, blood draw and orthostatic maneuvers and blood pressure measurements). Prodromal symptoms often preceded the syncope.
Orthostatic hypotension has been reported in clinical trials.

The most common adverse drug reactions (5%) reported during clinical trials were headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, insomnia and fatigue. The most common events leading to discontinuation were nausea and dizziness.

Precaution: General: Dapoxetine is only indicated in men with PE. Safety has not been established and there are no data on the ejaculation-delaying effects in men without PE.

Use with Recreational Drugs: Patients should be advised not to use Dapoxetine in combination with recreational drugs. Recreational drugs with serotonergic activity eg, ketamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may lead to potentially serious reactions if combined with Dapoxetine. These reactions include, but are not limited to, arrhythmia, hyperthermia and serotonin syndrome. 

Use of Dapoxetine with recreational drugs with sedative properties eg, narcotics and benzodiazepines may further increase somnolence and dizziness.

Ethanol: Combining alcohol with Dapoxetine may increase alcohol-related neurocognitive effects and may also enhance neurocardiogenic adverse events eg, syncope, thereby increasing the risk of accidental injury; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Dapoxetine.

Possibly prodromal symptoms eg, nausea, dizziness/lightheadedness and diaphoresis were reported more frequently among patients treated with Dapoxetine compared to placebo.

Orthostatic Hypotension: An orthostatic test should be performed before initiating therapy. In case of a history of documented or suspected orthostatic reaction, treatment with Dapoxetine should be avoided.

Dapoxetine is not indicated for psychiatric disorders and should not be used in men with these disorders eg, schizophrenia, or in those suffering with co-morbid depression, as worsening of symptoms associated with depression cannot be excluded.

Withdrawal Effects: Abrupt discontinuation of chronically administered SSRIs used to treat chronic depressive disorders has been reported to result in the following symptoms: Dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (eg, paresthesias, electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia and hypomania.

Dose: Usual oral dosage range is 0.5-10 mg daily. 

Dexamethasone can be given parenterally at doses of 0.5-20 mg daily, either as a single IV/IM injection or by IV infusion. 

Child: 200-500 mcg/kg daily. Cerebral oedema: 10 mg IV initially, then 4 mg IM every 6 hours as required for 2-10 days. Large IV doses should be given slowly to reduce the possibility of cardiovascular collapse.

Shock: By intravenous or intramascular injection or infusion 2-6 mg/kg, repeated if necessary after 2-6 hours.

The total daily intake of Dexamethasone, even in acute conditions should not exceed 80 mg except in certain very special circumstances.

Contra-indication: Ocular herpes simplex is an example of absolute contraindication to corticosteroid therapy. Relative contraindications are:
Gastrointestinal ulcer, acute or chronic infections, osteoporosis, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, hypertension, history of psychotic illness, immediate before prophylactic immunization and finally hypersensitivity to Dexamethasone.

Side effects: Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and allergic skin reactions has been reported. The incidence of predictable undesirable effects of glucocoticoids correlates with the dosage timing of administration and duration of treatment. Patients on prolonged Dexamethasone therapy are at risk of collapse and possibly death if their daily dose is not increased at times of severe physical stress e.g. injury, surgery or infections. The somatic manifestations include growth retardation in children, osteoporosis and aseptic bone necrosis, peptic ulceration, ocular hypertension, subcapsular cataract, pancreatic disturbances and myopathy. Other Cushing-like features characteristic of glucocorticoid excess includes truncal obesity, moon-face, oedema, delayed wound healing, glaucoma and various psychiatric syndromes. These are all generally reversible with discontinuation of Dexamethasone treatment.

Precaution: Dexamethasone should be used with caution in the presence of congestive heart failure or hypertension, in patients with diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, glaucoma, infectious disease, chronic renal failure and uraemia and in elderly persons.

Mode of action:  	Increased risk of hypokalaemia when used concurrently with potassium-depleting drugs such as amphotericin B and loop diuretics. Reduces efficacy of isoniazid, salicylates, vaccines and toxoids. Increased activity of dexamethasone and cyclosporin when used together. Concurrent use with aspirin or ethanol may lead to increased GI side effects.
Potentially Fatal: Reduced efficacy in combination with ephedrine, cholestyramine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and rifampicin.

     Charcot-like arthropathy

Precaution: This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive to heat.  Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial.

Following prolonged therapy, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in symptoms of the corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome including fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise.  This may occur in patients even without evidence of adrenal insufficiency.

There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis.

Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex for fear of corneal perforation.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction must be gradual.

Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations.  Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.

Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.

Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection, also in diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis.  

When large doses are given, some authorities advise that antacids be administered between meals to help to prevent peptic ulcer.

Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully followed.

Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients.

Phenytoin, phenobarbital, ephedrine, and rifampin may enhance the metabolic clearance of corticosteroids resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring adjustment in corticosteroid dosage.  These interactions may interfere with dexamethasone suppression tests which should be interpreted with caution during administration of these drugs.

When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting diuretics, patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia.

Intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid may produce systemic as well as local effects.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction: Dextran: Enzyme inducers e.g. phenytoin or carbamazepine and enzyme inhibitors e.g. cimetidine. Sodium Chloride: May affect serum concentrations of lithium.Indication: Hypovolaemic shock, Pulmonary embolism, Venous thrombosis, Open heart surgery

Dose: DextranI/V should be administered prior to administration of clinical dextran solutions.

    In shock, it is suggested that total dosage not exceed 20 mL/kg for adults and adolescents, during the first 24 hours. The first 10 mL/kg may be infused as rapidly as necessary to effect improvement. It is strongly recommended that central venous pressure be monitored frequently during the initial infusion of the drug. Should therapy continue beyond 24 hours, subsequent dosage should not exceed 10 mL/kg per day and therapy should not continue beyond five days.

  In prophylaxis of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, the dosage  for adults and adolescents, should be chosen according to the risk of thromboembolic complications, e.g., type of surgery and duration of immobilization. In general, treatment should be initiated during surgery; 500 to 1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg of body weight) should be administered on the day of operation. Treatment should be continued at a dose of 500 mL daily for an additional two to three days; then, according to the risk of complications, 500 mL may be given every second or third day during the period of risk, for up to two weeks.

    Infants may be given 5 mL per kg body weight and children 10 mL per kg.



Contra-indication: Patients with known hypersensitivity to dextran, in those with marked hemostatic defects of all types (thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, etc.) including those caused by drugs (heparin, warfarin, etc.), marked cardiac decompensation and in renal disease with severe oliguria or anuria.

Side effects: Because of the seriousness of anaphylactoid reactions, it is recommended that the infusion of intravenous dextran be stopped at the first sign of an allergic reaction provided that other means of sustaining the circulation are available. Resuscitative measures should be readily available for emergency administration in the event such a reaction occurs. In circulatory collapse due to anaphylaxis, rapid volume substitutions with an agent other than dextran should be instituted.

Precaution: The possibility of circulatory overload should be kept in mind. Special care should be exercised in patients with impaired renal clearance of dextran. When the risk of pulmonary edema and/or congestive heart failure may be increased, dextran should be used with caution.

In patients with normal hemostasis, dosage of LMD (dextran 40) approximating 15 mL/kg of body weight may prolong bleeding time and depress platelet function. Dosages in this range also markedly decrease factor VIII, and decrease factors V and IX to a greater degree than would be expected to occur from hemodilution alone. Since these changes tend to be more pronounced following trauma or major surgery, patients should be observed for early signs of bleeding complications.

Since increased rouleaux formation may occur in the presence of dextran, it is recommended that blood samples be drawn for typing and cross-matching prior to the infusion of dextran and reserved for subsequent use if necessary. If blood is drawn after infusion of dextran, the saline agglutination and indirect antiglobulin methods may be used for typing and cross-matching. Difficulty may be encountered when proteolytic enzyme techniques are used to match blood.

Consideration should be given to withdrawal of blood for chemical laboratory tests prior to initiating therapy with dextran because of the following:

    Blood sugar determinations that employ high concentrations of acid may result in hydrolysis of dextran, yielding falsely elevated glucose assay results. This has been observed both with sulfuric acid and with acetic acid.

    In other laboratory tests, the presence of dextran in the blood may result in the development of turbidity, which can interfere with the assay. This has been observed in bilirubin assays in which alcohol is employed and in total protein assays employing biuret reagent.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion.

	Indication: Dehydration, Fluid and Electrolytes imbalance

Dose: The dose is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical condition of the patient.

As reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.

If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

Precaution: Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion.

Mode of action: None

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:Indication: Dehydration, Fluid and Electrolytes imbalance

Dose: These solutions are for intravenous use only.

Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy.

When a hypertonic solution is to be administered peripherally, it should be slowly infused through a small bore needle, placed well within the lumen of a large vein to minimize venous irritation. Carefully avoid infiltration.

In the average adult, daily requirements of sodium and chloride are met by the infusion of one liter of fluid containing 0.9% sodium chloride (154 mEq each of sodium and chloride).

Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient.

Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Contra-indication: These solutions are contraindicated where the administration of sodium or chloride could be clinically detrimental.

Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to corn products.

Side effects: Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.

Too rapid infusion of hypertonic solutions may cause local pain and venous irritation. Rate of administration should be adjusted according to tolerance. Use of the largest peripheral vein and a small bore needle is recommended. 

Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.

Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water, resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume. If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.





Precaution: These solutions should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation. 

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients. Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Infusion of more than one liter of isotonic (0.9%) sodium chloride per day  can exceed normal tolerance, resulting in hypernatremia; this may also cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus, or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason. Hypokalemia may develop during parenteral administration of hypertonic dextrose solutions. Sufficient amounts of potassium should be added to dextrose solutions administered to fasting patients with good renal function, especially those on digitalis therapy.

These solutions are intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Contra-indication: Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with known allergy to corn or corn products.

A concentrated dextrose solution should not be used when intracranial or intraspinal hemorrhage is present nor in the presence of delirium tremens if the patient is already dehydrated.

Side effects: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and chills.

Reactions which may occur because of the injection or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.

If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

Precaution: Electrolyte deficits, particularly in serum potassium and phosphate, may occur during prolonged use of concentrated dextrose solutions. Blood electrolyte monitoring is essential, and fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be corrected. Essential vitamins and minerals also should be provided as needed. Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus. 

 Concentrated dextrose solutions should not be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion.

	Indication: Diarrhea, Dehydration, Vomiting, Fluid and Electrolytes imbalance

Dose: Daily dose should be equivalent to patients' fluid requirement for maintenance and replenishment of losses. During ORS therapy mother should not stop breast-feeding to their child and normal food should be continued in case of adults. Children less than 2 years: After each loose stool or vomiting 10 to 20 spoonful (50-100 ml) of prepared saline. Children 2 to 10 years: After each loose stool or vomiting 100-200 ml of prepared oral saline. Adult and children above 10 years: After each loose stool or vomiting 200-400 ml of prepared saline.

Contra-indication: Patients with known hypersensitivity.

Side effects: No significant side effects.

Precaution: Depressed renal function, severe continuing diarrhoea or other critical fluid losses may need supplementation with parenteral fluids along with oral saline. Reconstitue saline should be used within 6 hours.

Mode of action: None

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction:Indication: Acute renal failure, Chronic renal failure. Peritoneal dialysis,

Dose:  Solutions are provided for intraperitoneal administration only. The mode of therapy, frequency of treatment, formulation, exchange volume, duration of dwell, and length of dialysis should be selected by the physician responsible for the treatment of the individual patient.

In case of IPD: Usually  2 litres of peritoneal dialysis solutiion is instill into the abdominal cavity and dwell over a period of an hour then drained from the cavity. Exchange should be continued for 8-36 hours.

To avoid the risk of severe dehydration or hypovolemia and to minimize the loss of protein, it is advisable to select the peritoneal dialysis solution with lowest level of osmolarity consistent with the fluid removal requirements for that exchange.

Contra-indication: Patient with excessive obesity and pregnancy.

Side effects: Adverse reactions occurring with administration of peritoneal dialysis include mechanical and solution related problems as well as the results of contamination of equipment or improper technique in catheter placement. Abdominal pain, bleeding, peritonitis, subcutaneous infection around a peritoneal catheter, catheter blockage, difficulty in fluid removal, and ileus are among the complications of the procedure. Solution related adverse reactions may include peritonitis, catheter site infection, electrolyte and fluid imbalances, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, hypertension, hypotension, disequilibrium syndrome and muscle cramping.

If an adverse reaction does occur, institute appropriate therapeutic procedures according to the patient's needs and conditions, and save the remainder of the fluid in the bag for evaluation if deemed necessary.

Precaution: Solution should not be administered unless it is clear, all seals are intact, and there is no evidence of leaking.

Care should be taken to see that the catheter is inserted completely, since leakage around the catheter, if not controlled, can create edema from subcutaneous infiltration of the dialysis solution. This will also create an inaccurate fluid balance measurement.

Chronic patients that have been stabilized on peritoneal dialysis therapy should have routine evaluation of electrolyte blood chemistries and hematologic factors measured in order to determine the patient's ongoing condition.

Mode of action: None

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction:Indication: Cleansing of the colon

Dose: Sodium Phosphates Injection, USP is administered intravenously only after dilution in a larger volume of fluid. The dose and rate of administration are dependent upon the individual needs of the patient. Serum sodium, inorganic phosphorus and calcium levels should be monitored as a guide to dosage.

Withdraw the calculated volume aseptically and transfer to appropriate intravenous fluid to provide the desired number of millimoles (mM) of phosphorus and milliequivalents (mEq) of sodium. 

Contra-indication: Sodium Phosphates Injection, USP is contraindicated in diseases where high sodium, high phosphorus or low calcium levels may be encountered. 

Side effects: Adverse reactions involve the possibility of combined sodium and phosphorus intoxication from overdosage.

Sodium replacement therapy should be guided primarily by the serum sodium level. Use with caution in patients with renal impairment, cirrhosis, cardiac failure or other edematous or sodium retaining states. Phosphorus intoxication results in a reduction of serum calcium, and the symptoms are those of hypocalcemic tetany

Precaution: Phosphorus replacement therapy with sodium phosphates should be guided primarily by the serum inorganic phosphorus levels and the limits imposed by the accompanying sodium (Na+) ion. Frequent monitoring of serum calcium and sodium as well as renal function is recommended.

Use with caution in patients with renal impairment, cirrhosis, cardiac failure or in conjunction with other edema causing medications. It should not be used with sodium retaining medications.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids especially those containing sodium ion, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Lidocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide-type.

Side effects: Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.
The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly involve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are dose related. The CNS reaction may be manifested by drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lightheadness, etc. Incase of eye drops ocular burning sensation or allergic reaction may occur in 5-10% patients. 


Precaution: History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued.

Mode of action:  	May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.
May increase serum levels w/ cimetidine and propranolol. Increased risk of cardiac depression w/ ?-blockers and other antiarrhythmics. Additive cardiac effects w/ IV phenytoin. Hypokalaemia caused by acetazolamide, loop diuretics and thiazides may antagonise effect of lidocaine. Dose requirements may be increased w/ long-term use of phenytoin and other enzyme-inducers.

At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may be sometimes complaining of epigastric pain, eructation, nausea and diarrhea or dizziness or headache. These effects are usually mild in nature. Peripheral edema and skin reactions, such as rash and eczema have also been encountered. Gel may cause local irritation and reddening of the skin and skin rash.

Precaution: In rare instances where peptic ulceration or gastro-intestinal bleeding occurs in patients under treatment with Diclofenac. In patients with advanced age should be kept under close observation.Gel should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes or mucus membranes, after application the hands should be washed properly and not to be taken by mouth.

Mode of action: May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.

Contra-indication: A severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any tetanus toxoid-, diphtheria toxoid-, or pertussis antigen-containing vaccine or any component of this vaccine is a contraindication to administration. 

Progressive encephalopathies, with or without convulsions.
A severe reaction occurring within 48 hrs of a previous vaccine injection: Fever ?40°C; persistent crying syndrome; febrile or afebrile convulsions; hypotonic-hyporesponsive syndrome.

Side effects: Local reactions eg, pain, erythema or induration may occur at the injection site within the 48 hrs following vaccination.
Systemic reactions eg, fever occasionally >40°C, irritability, drowsiness, eating and sleeping disturbances, diarrhea, vomiting, and inconsolable prolonged crying.
More rarely urticaria, rash, convulsions with or without fever have been observed within 48 hrs following vaccination.
Hypotonic or hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes have been reported.
Edematous reactions of the lower limbs have been reported following administration of vaccines containing the Haemophilus influenzae type b valence. These reactions consist of edema with cyanosis or transient purpura affecting all of the vaccinated limb and sometimes the contralateral limb, appearing during the hrs following immunization, possibly lasting several hrs and resolving spontaneously without sequelae. These reactions are sometimes accompanied by fever, pain and crying.

Precaution:  A history of febrile convulsions not related to a previous vaccination does not constitute per se sufficient grounds for contraindication to immunization. 
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should be readily available for immediate use in case of a rare anaphylactic reaction following the administration of vaccine.
Haemophilus influenzae type b valence, the 2 vaccines, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-poliomyelitis and the H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine, should be administered at 2 separate injection sites and on 2 different days.

	Indication: Heart failure, Cardiac stress test

Dose: Adult: IV Acute heart failure 2.5-10 mcg/kg, up to 0.5-40 mcg/kg according to response. 

Cardiac stress test As 1 mg/mL soln: 5 mcg/kg/min for 8 mins, increase dose at 5 mcg/kg/min until 20 mcg/kg/min, w/ each dose being infused for 8 mins before the next increase.

Because of its short half-life, Dobutamine Hydrochloride must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Following the initiation of a constant rate infusion, or upon changing the rate, a steady-state dobutamine plasma concentration is achieved within approximately 10 minutes. Thus, loading doses or bolus injections are not necessary and are not recommended. 

Recommended Dosage The rate of infusion needed to increase cardiac output has ranged from 2.5 to 10 mcg/kg/min in the majority of patients. Frequently, doses up to 20 mcg/kg/min are required for adequate haemodynamic improvement. 

The rate of administration and the duration of therapy should be adjusted according to the patient's response, The indicators are: haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and rhythm, arterial pressure, and, whenever possible, cardiac output and measurements of ventricular filling pressures and signs of pulmonary congestion. 

Concentrations up to 5,000 mg/L have been administered to humans. The final volume administered should be determined by the fluid requirements of the patient. Rather than abruptly discontinuing therapy with Dobutamine Hydrochloride, it is often advisable to decrease the dosage gradually. Rates of Infusion Based on Concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride The rates of fluid infusion that are required to deliver specific dosages are a function of the concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride in the infusate.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity; idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS).

Side effects: Increased heart rate and BP, ectopic beats, palpitation. Nausea, headache, chest pain, palpitation, dyspnoea, paraesthesia, leg cramps. Tissue necrosis at site of extravasation.

Dose: Adult: PO Initial: 5 mg/day in the evening, up to 10 mg/day after 4-6 wk. The 5 mg (1 tab)/day dose should be maintained for at least one month in order to allow the earliest clinical responses to treatment to be assessed and to allow steady-state concentrations of donepezil hydrochloride to be achieved. 

Following a one-month clinical assessment of treatment at 5 mg/day, the dose can be increased to 10 mg/day (once-a-day dosing). Since food does not affect the rate or extent of absorption of donepezil, it can be administered with or without food. 

In case of renal & hepatic impairment: A similar dose schedule can be followed for patients with renal or mild to moderate hepatic impairment as clearance of donepezil hydrochloride is not affected by these conditions. 

In case of children: There are no adequate and well controlled trials in document to safety and efficacy of donepezil hydrochloride in any illness occurring in children. Donepezil is not recommended for use in children.


Contra-indication: Donepezil is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to donepezil hydrochloride or to piperidine derivatives.

	Indication: Anemia associated with Chronic Renal Failure, including patients on dialysis (ESRD) and patients not on dialysis, Anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies where anemia is due to the effect of concomitantly administered chemotherapy, Anemic patients (hemoglobin > 10 to < 13 g/dL) scheduled to undergo elective, noncardiac, nonvascular surgery to reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusions, Anemia related to therapy with zidovudine in HIV-infected patients.

Dose: Treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure: Erythropoietin is administered to maintain hemoglobin concentration between 11 to 12 g/dl and hematocrit of 33 -36 % in adults.

Starting dose:
Adult: usually 50 to 100 IU/kg three times in a week (TIW) by IV or Subcutaneous route
Pediatric: 50 IU/kg TIW by IV or Subcutaneous route

Dose adjustment: Dose should be increased if hematocrit doses not increase by 5 to 6 points after 8 weeks therapy, and hematocrit is below suggested target range. Dose should be reduced when hematocrit approaches 36% or hematocrit increases >4 points in any 2-week period.

Maintenance dose: Maintenance dose must be individualized for each patient. In patients undergoing dialysis, the median maintenance dose is 75 IU/kg TIW, with a range from 12.5 to 525 IU/kg TIW as directed by the physician. In CRF patients not on dialysis, maintenance dose is 75 to 150 IU/kg/week.

Treatment of Anemia in Cancer Patients on Chemotherapy
Starting dose:
Adult: 150 IU/kg TIW by Subcutaneous route or 40,000 IU Subcutaneous route weekly
Pediatric: 25 to 300 IU/kg 3 to 7 times per week by Subcutaneous or IV route

Dose adjustment: If the response is not satisfactory, the dose should be increased to 300 IU/kg TIW. If the hematocrit exceeds 40%, the dose should be withheld until the hematocrit falls to 36%. The dose should be reduced to 25% when treatment is resumed and titrated to maintain the desired hematocrit.

Surgery Patients
The recommended dose is 300 IU/kg/day subcutaneously for 10 days before surgery, on the day of surgery, and for 4 days after surgery. An alternate dose schedule is 600 IU/kg subcutaneously in once weekly dose (21, 14, and 7 days before surgery) plus a fourth dose on the day of surgery.

Zidovudine-treated HIV-infected Patients
Starting dose:
Adult: 100 IU/kg as an IV or Subcutaneous injection TIW for 8 weeks
Pediatric: 50 to 400 IU/kg 2 to 3 times per week by Subcutaneous or IV route

Dose adjustment: If the response is not satisfactory, the dose should be increased by 50-100 IU/kg TIW. Response should be evaluated every 4 to 8 weeks thereafter and the dose adjusted accordingly by 50 to 100 IU/kg increments TIW.

Maintenance dose: The dose is titrated to maintain the hematocrit between 33-36%.

Contra-indication: Uncontrolled hypertension, hypersensitivity to mammalian cell products and human albumin.

Side effects: General: Headache, dizziness, fever, malaise, arthralgia and occasionally hyperkalemia CVS: Hypertension is the most common side effect, palpitations. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia and diarrhea may occur occasionally. Allergic reactions.Potentially Fatal: Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms e.g. headache, confusion, generalised seizures. Thrombosis.

Precaution: Erythropoietin should be used with caution in those patients with controlled hypertension, ischaemic vascular disease, history of seizures, or suspected allergy to the product. Iron evaluation: Prior to and during Epoetin therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated. Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ferritin should be at least 100 ng/mL. Virtually all patients will require supplemental iron to increase or maintain transferrin saturation to levels that will adequately support erythropoiesis.

Mode of action:  	Haematinics enhance efficiency. Increased dose of heparin in patients undergoing dialysis.

	Indication: Partial-onset seizures

Dose: Adult: PO: The recommended starting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two weeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily.

Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been established.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients. Second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

Side effects: Allergic reactions: May cause serious skin rash or other serious allergic reactions
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) side effects are:
• Feeling dizzy or sleepy.
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) side effects are:
• Feeling unsteady or having a sensation of spinning or floating;
• Feeling sick or vomiting;
• Headache;
• Diarrhoea;
• Seeing double or blurred vision;
• Difficulty in concentration;
• Feeling low in energy or tired;
• Shaking;
• Skin rash;
• Blood tests showing that you have low levels of sodium in your blood;
• Decrease of appetite;
• Difficulty in sleeping;
• Difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia).

Precaution: Suicidal ideation
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic active substances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
Nervous system disorders
Eslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.
Oral contraceptives
Eslicarbazepine acetate may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended
Other warnings and precautions
If Eslicarbazepine is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential of increased seizure frequency.
Concomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may cause overexposure to the active metabolites.
Hyponatraemia
Hyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of patients treated with Eslicarbazepine. Hyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms like worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia increased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease leading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may themselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels should be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum sodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium levels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant hyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued.
PR interval
Prolongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.
Caution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac conduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation.
Renal impairment
Caution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance. In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is not recommended due to insufficient data.
Hepatic impairment
As clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic and clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Potentially Fatal: Anaphylaxis reactions, angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx.

Precaution: Initiate treatment only after careful evaluation of patients; failure of insomnia to remit after 7-10 days of treatment may indicate presence of primary psychiatric and/or medical illness requiring evaluation. May be associated with abnormal thoughts and behaviour changes e.g. bizarre behavior, agitation, hallucinations, depersonalization, decreased inhibition. Complex sleep-related behaviours with no memory of the incident such as "sleep-driving", preparing and eating food, making phone calls, having sex while not fully awake have been reported. Caution in patients with history of drug or alcohol dependence and/or abuse. Worsening of depression, emergence of suicidality have been reported. Eszopiclone has rapid onset of action and must be taken immediately before bedtime or after experiencing difficulty sleeping. May impair ability to drive or operate machinery. Hypersensitivity reaction including angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx, and symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis have been reported.

	Indication: Tuberculosis

Dose: Rimstar 4-FDC presents- Rifampicin 150mg + Isoniazid 75mg + Pyrazinamide 400mg + Ethambutol 275mg tablet. Patients should be given the following single daily dose of either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.

The total dosage requirement of rifampicin is 10 (8 to 12) mglkg/day, of isoniazid 5 (4 to 6) mglkglday, of pyrazinamide 25 (20 to 30) mglkg/day and of ethambutol 15 (15-20) mglkg/day.

New patients:
Body weight < 50kg, initial 2•months- Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily; next 4 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 450mg + Isoniazid 300mg daily.

Body weight >50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily; next 4 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 600mg + Isoniazid 300mg at a time daily.

Re-treatment patients:
Body weight < 50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily, & Streptomycin 15mg/kg daily; next 1 month Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily; next 5 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 450mg + Isoniazid 300mg daily, & Ethambutol 400mg 2 tablets (800mg) at a time daily.

Body weight >50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily, & Streptomycin 15mg/kg daily; next 1 month Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily; next 5 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 600mg + Isoniazid 300mg at a time daily, & Ethambutol 400mg 2 1/2 tablets (1000mg) at a time daily.


Contra-indication: Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide or any of the components, or to any of the rifamycins. 

Side effects: No serious adverse events were reported in the patients receiving   tablets. Three serious adverse events were reported in the patients given isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide as separate tablets and capsules. The three serious adverse events were two general hypersensitivity reactions and one jaundice reaction.

Precaution: For treatment of tuberculosis, rifampin is usually administered on a daily basis. Doses of rifampin (>600 mg) given once or twice weekly have resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including the "flu syndrome" (fever, chills and malaise); hematopoietic reactions (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or acute hemolytic anemia); cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and hepatic reactions; shortness of breath; shock, anaphylaxis, and renal failure. Recent studies indicate that regimens using twice-weekly doses of rifampin 600 mg plus isoniazid 15 mg/kg are much better tolerated.

Rifampin is not recommended for intermittent therapy; the patient should be cautioned against intentional or accidental interruption of the daily dosage regimen since rare renal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported when therapy was resumed in such cases.

Mode of action: Rifampicin: Induces microsomal enzymes (accelerates clearance of methadone, oral anticoagulants, glucocorticoids, oestrogen, oral hypoglycaemic agents, digitoxin, antiarrhythmics, theophylline, anticonvulsants, ?-blockers, azole antifungal, cyclosporin).

Cream is for short-term (up to 8 weeks) treatment of moderate to severe melasma of the face. It is not for long-term (more than 8 weeks) or maintenance (continuous) treatment of melasma.


Contra-indication:  A history of hypersensitivity, allergy, or intolerance to this product or any of its components.

Side effects: The most frequently reported events were erythema, desquamation, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and skin atrophy at the site of application.

	Indication:  Indicated for intravenous use in MRI to visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity (or those thought to cause abnormalities in the blood-brain barrier) in the brain (intracranial lesions), spine, and associated tissues

Dose: Adults: The recommended dose  is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) administered as a bolus intravenous injection. Pediatric Patients (2-16 years): The recommended dose  is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) administered as a bolus intravenous injection.

Contra-indication: Chronic, severe kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate, GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m²), or
acute kidney injury
prior hypersensitivity reaction

Side effects:    1. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis  .
  2.  Hypersensitivity reactions .

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Precaution: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities. 

The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m²) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. 

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. 

Mode of action: 

Pregnancy category: C

For patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,

Contra-indication:     Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure 

    Use in patients with known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone, glimepiride or any other component. 

    Use in patients with known history of an allergic reaction to sulfonamide derivatives. 

Side effects:     Congestive Heart Failure 
    Hypoglycemia 

    Edema 

    Fractures

    Hemolytic Anemia 

Precaution: Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when  is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of  must be considered 

Mode of action: Increased plasma levels w/ CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) and CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole). Decreased plasma levels w/ CYP2C8 inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Colesevelam may reduce the max plasma concentration and total exposure of glimepiride. Concominant use w/ oral miconazole may lead to severe hypoglycaemia.

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: The usual starting dose of 1mg/4 mg or 2 mg/4 mg once daily.
The maximum recommended daily dose of is 4 mg of Glimepiride and 8 mg of Rosiglitazone.
The dosage of anti-diabetic therapy should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability. 


Contra-indication: Patients with established Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated.

Side effects: Hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, nausea, allergic skin reactions, e.g., pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions.

Rosiglitazone:The mostcommon adverse experiences with Rosiglitazone are upper
respiratory tract infection, injury, and headache. Events of anemia and edema tended to be reported more frequently at higher doses, angioedema and urticaria have been reported rarely.


Precaution: Hypoglycemia: All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal, pituitary
, renal, or hepatic insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose lowering drugs.
Loss of Control of Blood Glucose:
When a patient stabilized on any antidiabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a temporary loss of glycemic control may occur.

Edema:
Combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients with edema.
Since thiazolidinediones, including Rosiglitazone can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, Combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients at risk for heart failure.
Weight Gain:
Dose-related weight gain was seen with Rosiglitazone alone and in combination with other hypoglycemic agents. 
Hepatic Effects:
Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical
judgment of the healthcare professional. 

Mode of action: Glimepiride: Salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, coumarin anticoagulants, probenecid, CYP2C9 inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, disopyramide, fluoxetine, quinolones, ACE inhibitors, MAOIs and ?-blockers may potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride.

Interaction: Effects may be increased by drugs with antimuscarinic effect such as; some antihistamines; phenothiazines; antipsychotics; TCAs; MAOIs or parasympathomimetics.Indication: Postexposure prophylaxis of Rabies

Dose: Recommended Dose: Adults and Children: 40 IU/kg of body weight. However, for children, particularly in the case of multiple wounds, it has been proposed to dilute the dose 2-3 times in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution to obtain a sufficient quantity of equine rabies immune globulin to infiltrate the wound(s) correctly.

It must be injected slowly by the IM route.
If anatomically feasible, as much as possible of the dose should be infiltrated around and into the wounds. The remainder of the dose should be administered IM (into the gluteal region) in a single injection.

As a general rule, 1 IU of Factor IX activity per kg can be expected to increase the circulating level of Factor IX by 1% [IU/dL] of normal.

Contra-indication: Known history of allergic symptoms to horse proteins.

Side effects: Do not administer the vaccine IV due to the risk of shock ie, sudden collapse with drop in blood pressure. 

Precaution: Administered intravenously at a rate that will permit observation of the patient for any immediate reaction. Rates of infusion of up to 225 IU per minute have been regularly tolerated with no adverse reactions. If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration   , the rate of infusion should be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient. The infusion should be stopped promptly and appropriate countermeasures and supportive therapy should be administered should evidence of an acute hypersensitivity reaction be observed. Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene may be at increased risk for inhibitor formation and acute hypersensitivity reactions.

Mode of action: Decreased response to live virus vaccine (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella and varicella), admin at least 4 mth after human rabies immunoglobulin admin.

	Indication: Prevention of Rotavirus diarrhea

Dose: The vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose should be given between 6 and 14 weeks of age. The interval between the two doses should not be less than 4 weeks. The vaccine course should be completed by the age of 24 weeks as safety has not been assessed in older children. In clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such circumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same vaccination visit.

Contra-indication: Subjects with history of intussusception. Subjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a contraindication for immunisation.

Side effects: Risk of intussusception has not been established. The overall incidence of intussusception remains rare.

Precaution: It is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. Parents/guardians should be advised to seek medical advice promptly where these signs/symptoms are evident. There is a potential risk for transmission to non-vaccinated contacts. It should be administered with caution to infants with close contacts who are immunodeficient, such as household members with malignancies or who are otherwise immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Contacts of recent vaccinees should be advised to observe personal hygiene (e.g. washing their hands when changing childrenâ€™s nappies).

	Square	Pracort Ointment    60
	Indication: Hemorrhoids, Insect bites, Skin irritations, Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, Anal itching

Dose: Topical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin film three to four times daily depending on the severity of the condition. Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.

Contra-indication: Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation.

Side effects:  If the drug is absorbed in the system patient may feel blurred vision, halos around lights, irregular heart rate, insomnia. Redness, burning, itching and irritation may occur in application site.

Precaution: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area and under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.

Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity.  

If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

	Indication: Chloasma, Melasma, Freckles, Senile lentigines, Hyperpigmentation

Dose: Hydroquinone should be applied to the affected area and rubbed in well twice daily or as directed by a physician. Most discolorations begin to lighten after 4 weeks of treatment but it may take longer. After desired bleaching, use only as needed to maintain results of treatment. Hydroquinone bleaching is faster, more dependable and easier if the treated area is protected from ultraviolet light. Therefore, exposure to sunlight should be minimized at the period of treatment. During day, an effective broad-spectrum sunscreen should be used, unnecessary solar exposure should be avoided and protective clothing should be used to prevent repigmentation of treated areas. After reduction of hyperpigmentation, use of sunscreen agents and/or protective clothing should continue.Use in children: Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.

Contra-indication: Hydroquinone is contraindicated to patients with prior history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to hydroquinone or other ingredients in the preparation.

Side effects: No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur in which case the medication should be discontinued.

Precaution: Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin to check in 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, further treatment is not advised. If no bleaching or lightening effect is noted after 2 months of treatment, the medication should be discontinued.Contact with the eyes and lips should be avoided. Hydroquinone should not be applied to cut or abraded skin.

	Indication: Vitamin B12 deficiency, Cyanide poisoning

Dose: Thirty mcg daily for 5 to 10 days followed by 100 to 200 mcg monthly injected intramuscularly. If the patient is critically ill, or has neurologic disease, an infectious disease or hyperthyroidism, considerably higher doses may be indicated. However, current data indicate that the optimum obtainable neurologic response may be expected with a dosage of vitamin B12 sufficient to produce good hematologic response. Children may be given a total of 1 to 5 mg over a period of 2 or more weeks in doses of 100 mcg, then 30 to 50 mcg every 4 weeks for maintenance.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.

Side effects: Mild transient diarrhea, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of entire body, and anaphylaxis.

A few patients may experience pain after injection of hydroxocobalamin.

Precaution: General

The validity of diagnostic vitamin B12 or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy.

Vitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid and since it might improve folic acid deficient megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12 could mask the true diagnosis.

Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with B12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

Contra-indication: Imipramine should not be given in conjunction with, or within 14 days of treatment with a MAO inhibitor. Combined therapy of this type could lead to the appearance of serious interactions such as hypertensive crises, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, spasticity, severe convulsions or coma and death may occur. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients with existing severe hepatic or renal damage, and those with a history of blood dyscrasias. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants belonging to the dibenzazepine group. Imipramine is contraindicated for use during the acute recovery phase following a myocardial infarction. It should not be used in patients with convulsive disorders or glaucoma. 

Side effects: The most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Imipramine usage has been linked to both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported. Confusion, disorientation, delusions, insomnia, and anxiety have also been reported as side effects in a small percentage of people taking imipramine. Problems associated with the skin (loss of sensation, numbness and tingling, rashes, spots, itching and puffiness), seizures, and ringing in the ears have also been reported. Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping are all side effects associated with imipramine usage in a small number of people.

Precaution: Imipramine should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when imipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines. Imipramine may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic dosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is increased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of pre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.

Mode of action: Increased plasma levels and effects with quinidine, cimetidine, SSRIs, propafenone, flecainide. Reduced plasma levels with barbiturates, phenytoin. May increase effects of anticholinergic drugs. Severe orthostatic hypotension with altretamine. Causes drowsiness and impaired performance in combination with alcohol.
Potentially Fatal: Severe hypertension with adrenaline, noradrenaline and methylphenidate. Reduces hypotensive effects of guanethidine, bethanidine, debrisoquine, bretylium, methyldopa and clonidine. Possible serotonin syndrome with MAOIs, separate admin by 3 wk.

	Indication: Diabetes Mellitus

Dose: Adult: S/C: Insulin Degludec is ultra long-acting basal insulin for once-daily at any time of the day, preferably at the same time every day.
Initiation:
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:
The recommended daily starting dose is 10 units followed by individual dosage adjustments.

Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus:
Insulin Degludec is to be used once-daily with meal-time insulin and requires subsequent individual dosage adjustments.


In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Insulin Degludec can be administered alone or in any combination with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists and bolus insulin.

In type 1 diabetes mellitus, Insulin Degludec must be combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin to cover mealtime insulin requirements.

On occasions when administration at the same time of the day is not possible, Insulin Degludec allows for flexibility in the timing of insulin administration. A minimum of 8 hours between injections should always be ensured.

Patients who forget a dose, are advised to take it upon discovery and then resume their usual once-daily dosing schedule.

Special populations:

Elderly patients (> 65 years old):

Insulin Degludec can be used in elderly patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.

Renal and hepatic impairment:

Degludec can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.

Paediatric population:

The safety and efficacy of Insulin Degludec in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been established.




Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.Hypoglycaemia, Hyperglycaemia, Eye disorder.

Side effects: Hypoglycemia, Lipodystrophy & Reactions at the site of injection may occur. 
Rarer side effects include: Hypersensitivity, Urticaria, Peripheral oedema


Precaution: Insulin Degludecs must not be injected into a vein (intravenously) or a muscle (intramuscularly) and must not be used in infusion pumps.

There is no experience with Insulin Degludec in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

Mode of action: Possible absence of hypoglycaemic warning symptoms with ?-blockers. Decreased hypoglycaemic effect with corticosteroids, danazol, diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, phenothiazine derivatives, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents, thyroid hormones, oestrogens, progestins (e.g. in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic (e.g. olanzapine and clozapine). Increased hypoglycaemic effect with oral antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, MAOIs, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics. Decreased insulin resistance with octreotide and lanreotide. Increased risk of wt gain and peripheral oedema with pioglitazone, rosiglitazone. Decreased effect of sermorelin.

Pregnancy category: B

Decreased effect of sermorelin.Novo Nordisk	Ryzodeg FlexTouch Injection 100IU/ml  
	Indication: Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults.

Dose: Adult: SC: This is a soluble insulin product consisting of the basal insulin degludec and the rapid-acting prandial insulin aspart.
This can be administered once- or twice-daily with the main meal(s). When needed, the patient can change the time of administration as long as this insulin is dosed with the largest meal when taken once daily.
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus this insulin can be administered alone, in combination with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, and in combination with bolus insulin.
In type 1 diabetes mellitus, this insulin is combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals.
This is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient’s needs. Dose-adjustments are recommended to be primarily based on fasting plasma glucose measurements.

Initiation
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
The recommended total daily starting dose is 10 units with meal(s) followed by individual dosage adjustments.
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus
The recommended starting dose is 60–70% of the total daily insulin requirements. This is to be used once-daily at meal-time in combination.

Renal and hepatic impairment
Thiss insulin can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.

Side effects: The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia.  
Immune system disorders
With insulin preparations, allergic reactions may occur. Immediate-type allergic reactions to either insulin itself or the excipients may potentially be life-threatening.
With Ryzodeg, hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhoea, nausea, tiredness and itching) and urticaria were reported rarely.

Lipodystrophy
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the particular injection area may help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions.
Injection site reactions
Injection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) occurred in patients treated with
Ryzodeg. These reactions are usually mild and transitory and they normally disappear during continued treatment.



Precaution: Hypoglycaemia
Omission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Concomitant illness, especially infections and fever, usually increases the patient's insulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose.


Hyperglycaemia
Administration of rapid-acting insulin is recommended in situations with severe hyperglycaemia. Inadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of treatment in patients requiring insulin may lead to hyperglycaemia and potentially to diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially infections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased insulin requirement.

Eye disorder
Intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.

Avoidance of accidental mix-ups
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between Ryzodeg and other insulin products.

Older patients (? 65 years old)
Ryzodeg can be used in older patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.

Paediatric population
Ryzodeg has been administered to children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for the investigation of pharmacokinetic properties. Safety and efficacy have not been investigated in children and adolescents.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction:Indication: Peripheral and coronary arteriography and left ventriculography,Intravenous excretory urography,Angiography

Dose: As with all radiopaque contrast agents, only the lowest dose necessary to obtain adequate visualization should be used. A lower dose may reduce the possibility of an adverse reaction. Most procedures do not require use of either the maximum volume or the highest concentration . The combination of volume and concentration  to be used should be carefully individualized accounting for factors such as age, body weight, size of the vessel and the rate of blood flow within the vessel. Other factors such as anticipated pathology, degree and extent of opacification required, structure(s) or area to be examined, disease processes affecting the patient, and equipment and technique to be employed should be considered.

It is desirable that intravascularly administered iodinated contrast agents be at or close to body temperature when injected.

If during administration a reaction occurs, the injection should be stopped until the reaction has subsided.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Usually mild to moderate, of short duration and resolve spontaneously (without treatment). However, serious, life-threatening and fatal reactions, mostly of cardiovascular origin, have been associated with the administration of iodine-containing contrast media.

Injections of contrast media are often associated with sensations of warmth and pain. In controlled double-blind clinical studies, significantly less warmth and pain were associated with the injection   than with iothalamate meglumine, diatrizoate meglumine, and diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium.

Precaution: Diagnostic procedures which involve the use of iodinated intravascular contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel skilled and experienced in the particular procedure to be performed. A fully equipped emergency cart, or equivalent supplies and equipment, and personnel competent in recognizing and treating adverse reactions of all types should always be available. Since severe delayed reactions have been known to occur, emergency facilities and competent personnel should be available for at least 30 to 60 minutes after administration.

	Indication:  Iron deficiency anaemia



Dose: Parenteral
Iron-deficiency anaemia
Adult: As a preparation containing the equivalent of 50 mg/ml of iron. Total dose (ml) = 0.0442 (desired haemoglobin - observed haemoglobin) x LBW + (0.26 x LBW) (Note: LBW = Lean body weight(kg)) A test dose of 0.5 ml should be given and observe patient for at least 1 hr for signs for hypersensitivity. Usual daily max: 2 ml (100 mg). Total dose may be given in divided doses on a daily or twice wkly basis via IM inj (into the upper outer quadrant of the buttock); may also be given intravenously by total-dose infusion or as divided inj.

Child: As a preparation containing the equivalent of 50 mg/ml of iron. Total dose (ml) = 0.0442 (desired haemoglobin - observed haemoglobin) x LBW + (0.26 x LBW) (Note: LBW = Lean body weight(kg)) A test dose (<10 kg: 0.2 ml; 10-20 kg: 0.3 ml) should be given and observe the patient for at least 1 hr for signs of hypersensitivity. Usual daily max: <5 kg: Up to 0.5 ml (25 mg); 5-9 kg: Up to 1 ml (50 mg); larger children: 2 ml (100 mg). Total dose may be given in divided doses on a daily or twice wkly basis via IM inj (into the upper outer quadrant of the buttock); may also be given intravenously by total-dose infusion or as divided inj.



Intravenous drip infusion:

It must be diluted only in 0.9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline) or in 5% glucose solution. In a dose of 100-200 mg iron (2-4ml) may be diluted in 100 ml. On each occasion the first 25 mg of iron should be infused over a period of 15 minutes. If no adverse reactions occur during this time the remaining portion of the infusion should be given at an infusion rate of not more than 100 ml in 30 minutes.

Intravenous injection:

It may be administered in a dose of 100 – 200 mg iron (2-4 ml) by slow intravenous injection (0.2 ml/min) preferably diluted in 10 – 20 ml 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose solution. On each occasion before administering a slow intravenous injection, 25 mg of iron should be injected slowly over a period of 1 to 2 minutes. If no adverse reactions occur within 15 minutes, the remaining portion of the injection may be given. 

Contra-indication: Known serious hypersensitivity to other parenteral iron products.

Non-iron deficiency anaemia (e.g. haemolytic anaemia).

Iron overload or disturbances in utilisation of iron (e.g. haemochromatosis, haemosiderosis).

Decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatitis.

Acute or chronic infection, because parenteral iron administration may exacerbate bacterial or viral infections.

Acute renal failure. 

Side effects: Anaphylactoid reactions are uncommon and include urticaria, rashes, itching, nausea and shivering. Administration must be stopped immediately when signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed.

Acute, severe anaphylactoid reactions are very rare. They usually occur within the first few minutes of administration and are generally characterised by the sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and / or cardiovascular collapse; fatalities have been reported.

Delayed reactions are well described and may be severe. They are characterised by arthralgia, myalgia and sometimes fever. The onset varies from several hours up to four days after administration. Symptoms usually last two to four days and settle spontaneously or following the use of simple analgesics.

Exacerbation of joint pain in rheumatoid arthritis can occur. Local reactions reported are soreness and inflammation at or near injection site and local phlebitic reaction.

Local complications at the injection site after intramuscular injection such as staining of the skin, bleeding, formation of sterile abscesses, tissue necrosis or atrophy and pain are observed.

Precaution: Parenterally administered iron preparations can cause hypersensitivity reactions including serious and potentially fatal anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported after previously uneventful doses of parenteral iron complexes.

The risk is enhanced for patients with known allergies including drug allergies, including patients with a history of severe asthma, eczema or other atopic allergy.

Hypotensive episodes may occur if intravenous injection is administered too rapidly.

Mode of action: Reduced Fe absorption upon oral Fe administration earlier than 5 days after the last inj. Reduced effect when used with chloramphenicol.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Reduced Fe absorption upon oral Fe administration earlier than 5 days after the last inj. Reduced effect when used with chloramphenicol.ACI	Mylovit CAP  100's pack 302

	Indication: Vitamin/mineral deficiency during pregnancy and lactation

Dose: Adults (persons over 12 years of age), One (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician. Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12.

Contra-indication:  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms.

Side effects:  Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn and vomiting) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Reducing the dose and administering it with meals will minimize these effects in the sensitive patient. Increasing fiber in the diet can relieve constipation. Iron may turn stools black. This is a harmless effect that is a result of unabsorbed iron. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Integra FTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Integra FTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime.

Precaution: General: Anemia is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes. No single regimen fits all cases and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential. Blood examinations including hemoglobin and hematacrit should be done at the usual intervals to make certain that therapy is adequate. Use with care in the presence of peptic ulcer, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg -0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

Mode of action: Iron: Antacids may decrease the absorption of carbonyl iron.

Folic acid: Antiepileptics, oral contraceptives, anti-TB drugs, alcohol, aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim and sulphonamides may result to decrease in serum folate contrations. Decreases serum phenytoin concentrations.

Vit C: Deferroxamine, hormonal contraceptives, flufenazine, warfarin, elemental iron, salicylates, warfarin, fluphenazine, disulfiram, mexiletine, vitamin B12.

	Indication: Tuberculosis

Dose: Total Dosage Requirement: Rifampicin: 10 (8-12) mg/kg body mass/day.
Isoniazid: 5 (4-6) mg/kg body mass/day.
Pyrazinamide: 25 (20-30) mg/kg body mass/day.

Patients weighing <44 kg – 4 tablets
Patients weighing between 45-54 kg – 5 tablets
Patients weighing > 55 kg – 6 tablets

Pediatric Patients

The ratio of the drugs may not be appropriate in pediatric patients under the age of 15 (e.g., higher mg/kg doses of isoniazid are usually given in pediatric patients than adults).

The tablets should be given as a single dose, preferably on an empty stomach, at least 30 min before breakfast to ensure a high peak serum concentration.
Tablets are recommended in the initial intensive phase of the short course treatment of tuberculosis. During this phase which lasts for 2 months,

Contra-indication: Known or suspected hypersensitivity to rifamycins and/or to isoniazid and to pyrazinamide and/or to any of the excipients including a history of drug-induced hepatitis, acute liver diseases regardless of their origin, and peripheral neuritis.

Side effects: Unwanted effects which may occur during continuous daily or intermittent therapy: Rifampicin: Rifampicin may cause reddish discolouration of body fluids and occasionally other body secretions eg, urine, sputum, lacrimal fluid, faeces, saliva and sweat. It may permanently discolour soft contact lenses.
Hepatic Effects: Very common (>10%) is an asymptomatic increase in liver enzymes; severe life-threatening hepatic reactions eg, hepatic failure and acute fulminant hepatitis are uncommon (>0.1% and <1%). In isolated cases (<0.01%), a fatal outcome was observed.
Renal Effects: Elevations of BUN and serum uric acid, haemolysis, haematuria, interstitial nephritis, renal insufficiency.
Gastrointestinal Effects: Nausea, abdominal pains, vomiting or diarrhoea, pseudomembranous colitis.
Central and Peripheral Nervous System Effects: Tiredness, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, ataxia, mental confusion, muscular weakness, visual disturbances.
Haematological Changes: Leucopenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenic purpura.
Effects on Skin and Appendages: Flushing, itching with or without skin rash, urticaria, reddening of the eyes, exudative conjunctivitis or generalised hypersensitivity reactions involving the skin eg, exfoliative dermatitis, Lyell's syndrome and pemphigoid reactions.
Endocrine Effects: Disturbances in the menstrual cycle, induction of crisis in Addison patients.
Unwanted effects chiefly occurring during intermittent therapy or upon resumption of treatment after temporary interruption:

Precaution: Caution is advised in patients with impaired renal or liver function, diabetes mellitus, chronic alcoholism and undernourished patients, patients with a history of gout and patients suffering from convulsive disorders and acute porphyria. Precautions need to be taken: Blood counts and liver function tests (SGPT, SGOT) should be performed periodically (especially in prolonged treatment) and at baseline, if possible.
Patients with current chronic liver disease or impaired liver function should be treated with caution and under strict medical supervision. Careful monitoring of liver function should be carried out and attention should be paid to possible prodromal symptoms of hepatitis eg, fatigue, weakness, malaise, anorexia, nausea or vomiting. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, treatment should be discontinued promptly. The occurrence of severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated may develop even after many months of treatment.

Mode of action: Rifampicin may reduce effectivity of hormonal contraceptives, ACE inhibitors (e.g. enalapril, imidapril), antiemetics (e.g. aprepitant), antineoplastics (e.g. imatinib), diuretics (e.g. eplerenone), drugs for erectile dysfunction (e.g. tadalafil), oral hypoglycaemics (e.g. nateglinide, repaglinide), NSAIDs (e.g. etoricoxib). Rifampicin may reduce serum levels of atovaquone, ketoconazole. Antacids may reduce absorption of rifampicin. Anaesthetics and halothane may increase risk for hepatotoxicity w/ rifampicin and isoniazid. 

Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin and theophylline; and may decrease carbamazepine metabolism. Stavudine may increase risk of distal sensory neuropathy w/ isoniazid. Antacids may reduce isoniazid absorption. May increase plasma levels of isoniazid w/ para-aminosalicylic acid. Increased risk of CNS toxicity when isoniazid is used concomitantly w/ cycloserine. 

Pyrazinamide antagonizes the effects of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone.

Potentially Fatal: Concominant use w/ saquinavir/ritonavir may increase risk of severe hepatotoxicity. May reduce antiviral efficacy of atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir

Precaution: Safe use of leuprolide acetate or norethindrone acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Before starting treatment with LUPRON DEPOT, pregnancy must be excluded.

When used monthly at the recommended dose, LUPRON DEPOT usually inhibits ovulation and stops menstruation. Contraception is not insured, however, by taking LUPRON DEPOT. Therefore, patients should use non-hormonal methods of contraception.

Patients should be advised to see their physician if they believe they may be pregnant. If a patient becomes pregnant during treatment, the drug must be discontinued and the patient must be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus.

During the early phase of therapy, sex steroids temporarily rise above baseline because of the physiologic effect of the drug. Therefore, an increase in clinical signs and symptoms may be observed during the initial days of therapy, but these will dissipate with continued therapy.
Norethindrone acetate treatment should be discontinued if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, medication should be withdrawn.

Neonates < 7 days: Most pre-term neonates < 7 days of age (gestational age < 34 weeks) have lower systemic linezolid clearance values and larger AUC values than many full-term neonates and older infants. These neonates should be initiated with a dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg every 12 hours. Consideration may be given to the use of 10 mg/kg in every eight hours regimen in neonates with a sub-optimal clinical response. All neonatal patients should receive 10 mg/kg t.i.d. by 7 days of life.

Contra-indication: Linzolid formulations are contraindicated for use in patients who have known hypersensitivity to Linzolid or any of the other product components. Linzolid should not be used in patients taking any medicinal product which inhibits monoamine oxidases A or B (e.g. phenelzine, isocarboxazid) or within two weeks of taking any such medicinal product. Linzolid should not be administered to patients with uncontrolled hypertension, pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, carcinoid syndrome and/or patients taking directly and indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents (e.g. pseudoephedrine), vasopressive agents (e.g. epinephrine, norepinephrine), dopaminergic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine), serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine or buspirone.

Side effects: Most of the adverse events reported with Linzolid were mild to moderate in intensity. The most common adverse events in patients treated with Linzolid were diarrhea, headache and nausea. Other adverse included oral moniliasis, vaginal moniliasis, hypertension, dyspepsia, localized abdominal pain, pruritus, and tongue discoloration.

Precaution: Patients who develop recurrent nausea or vomiting, unexplained acidosis, or low bicarbonate level while receiving Linzolid should receive immediate medical evaluation. Where administration of Linzolid and concomitant serotonergic agents is clinically appropriate, patients should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as cognitive dysfunction, hyperpyrexia, hyper reflexia and incoordination. If signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents. If the concomitant serotonergic agent is withdrawn, discontinuation symptoms can be observed. If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment, such as changes in visual acuity, changes in color vision, blurred vision, or visual field defect, prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended. Convulsions have been reported in patients when treated with Linzolid. In some of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures was reported.

Mode of action: May reduce serum levels w/ rifampicin and phenytoin. May cause hypoglycaemia w/ insulin or oral antidiabetics. May increase risk of seizures w/ tramadol.

	Indication: Type 2 diabetes

Dose: It can be administered once daily at any time of day, independently of meals, and can be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment.

For all patients  should be initiated with a dose of 0.6 mg per day for one week. The 0.6 mg dose is a starting dose intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms during initial titration, and is not effective for glycemic control. After one week at 0.6 mg per day, the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. If the 1.2 mg dose does not result in acceptable glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg.

When initiating , consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia

Contra-indication: Do not use in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).

Do not use in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to   any of the product components.

Side effects: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Precaution: In the clinical trials, there have been 6 reported cases of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia among Victoza-treated patients and 2 cases in comparator-treated patients (1.3 vs. 1.0 cases per 1000 patient-years). One comparator-treated patient with MTC had pre-treatment serum calcitonin concentrations >1000 ng/L suggesting pre-existing disease. All of these cases were diagnosed after thyroidectomy, which was prompted by abnormal results on routine, protocol-specified measurements of serum calcitonin. Five of the six Victoza-treated patients had elevated calcitonin concentrations at baseline and throughout the trial. One Victoza and one non-Victoza-treated patient developed elevated calcitonin concentrations while on treatment. 

Mode of action: Oral Contraceptives: Liraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. Tmax was delayed by 1.5 hrs with liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of either ethinyloestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide.

Warfarin: No interaction study has been performed. Upon initiation of Liraglutide treatment in patients on warfarin more frequent monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) is recommended.

Insulin: Combination of Liraglutide with insulin has not been evaluated.

Incompatibilities: Substances added to Liraglutide may cause degradation of liraglutide. In the absence of compatibility studies, Liraglutide must not be mixed with other medicinal products.

Dose: Unless prescribed otherwise, doses are as follows: Sterility in Females: The dosage of HMG for the induction of follicle growth in normo- or hypogonadotrophic women varies according to the individual. The amount depends on ovarian reaction and should be checked by ultrasound examinations of the ovaries and measuring estradiol levels. If the HMG dosage is too high for the treated individual, multiple uni- and bilateral follicle growth can occur. HMG is administered IM or SC and in general, the therapy is begun with a daily dosage corresponding to 75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH daily. If the ovaries do not respond, the dosage can slowly be increased until a rise in estradiol secretion and follicle growth is evident. Treatment with the same dosage of HMG continues until the preovulatory estradiol serum level is attained. If the level rises too quickly, the dosage should be reduced. To induce ovulation, hCG 5000 or 10,000 IU are injected IM 1-2 days after the last HMG administration. Note: After administering a HMG dosage which is too high for the corresponding individual, a subsequent hCG administration can cause an unintentional hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Sterility in Males: Initially, 3 x 1000 and 3000 IU hCG a week are administered until a normal testosterone serum level is reached. Then, an additional dose of HMG 3 x (75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH)/week is administered IM for a few months.

Contra-indication: Females: Pregnancy, enlargement of the ovaries or cysts that is not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome, gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause and tumors in the uterus, ovaries and breasts.
Males: Carcinoma of the prostate and tumors in the testes.
The following conditions must be properly treated before therapy with HMG is begun: Dysfunctions of the thyroid gland and of the cortex of the suprarenal gland, a rise in the serum level of prolactin with different causes (hyperprolactinaemia), tumors in the pituitary gland (hypophysis) or in part of the diencephalon (hypothalamus).

Side effects: Occasionally, nausea and vomiting can occur.
In single cases, hypersensitivity reactions and fever can occur during treatment with HMG. The administration of Menogon may lead to reactions at the injection site: Reddening, pain, swelling and itching. In very rare cases, long-term usage can lead to the formation of antibodies, making the therapy ineffective.
Treatment with HMG can often lead to ovarian hyperstimulation that first becomes clinically relevant after the administration of hCG (pregnancy hormone) to induce ovulation. This can lead to the formation of large ovarian cysts that tend to rupture and to intra-abdominal bleeding.
In addition, the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal cavity (ascites), the accumulation of fluids in the chest cavity (hydrothorax), a decrease in the excretion of urine (oliguria), lowering of the blood pressure (hypotension), and occlusion of blood vessels by blood clots (thromboembolic phenomena) can occur. Treatment should be immediately discontinued when the first signs of hyperstimulation appear: Abdominal pain and a palpable (by the physician) enlargement in the lower abdomen, which can be detected sonographically.
If abdominal pain occurs, see the doctor.
With pregnancy, these side effects can intensify, continue over a long period of time, and be life threatening.
Unintentional multiple pregnancies occur more often during treatment with HMG.

Precaution: hCG should not be administered to induce ovulation in females whose ovaries have unintentionally been hyperstimulated.
When treating sterile women, ovarian activity should be checked (ultrasound and estradiol levels in serum response) prior to HMG administration. During treatment, these tests should be carried out every 1-2 days until stimulation occurs. Ovarian reaction can also be measured using a cervix index. Close supervision is imperative during treatment. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if unintentional hyperstimulation occurs.
Further remarks concerning the steps to be taken when ovarian hyperstimulation has occurred can be found under Actions.

	Indication: Polycystic ovarian syndrome, Type 2 DM

Dose: The usual starting dose is 500 mg twice daily or 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increase should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. 

Patients can be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For these patients requiring additional glycaemic control, metformin may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. 

Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated when given three times a day with meals. The usual starting dose of Metformin HCl extended - release tablet is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal. Dosage increase may be made up to a max. of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal.

Polycystic ovary syndrome Initial: 500 mg/day in the morning for 1 wk, then 500 mg twice daily for 1 wk, then 1.5-1.7 g/day in 2-3 divided doses.

Contra-indication: Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis with or without coma (including diabetic ketoacidosis). Renal failure, severe renal or hepatic impairment, acute conditions which may affect renal function e.g. dehydration, severe infection or shock. Cardiac failure, CHF, IDDM, severe impairment of thyroid function; acute or chronic alcoholism. Acute or chronic diseases which may cause tissue hypoxia e.g. cardiac or respiratory failure, recent MI or shock. Pregnancy, lactation. 	Adult: PO Type 2 DMInitial: 500 mg 2-3 times/day, may increase slowly. Max:2.25 g/day. Polycystic ovary syndrome Initial: 500 mg/day in the morning for 1 wk, then 500 mg twice daily for 1 wk, then 1.5-1.7 g

Side effects: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, wt loss, flatulence, occasional metallic taste; weakness; hypoglycaemia; rash, malabsorption of vit B12. Chest discomfort, flushing, palpitation, chills, headache, lightheadedness, indigestion, abdominal discomfort. Potentially Fatal: Lactic acidosis in presence of renal failure and alcoholism. Patients may experience a metallic taste and there may be weight loss, which in some diabetics could be an advantage.

Precaution: Caution when used in patients with CHF especially in those with unstable or acute heart failure. Risk of lactic acid accumulation increases with the degree of renal impairment. May need to discontinue treatment in patients with stress-related states e.g. fever, trauma, infection or surgery. Metformin should be temporarily discontinued for 48 hr in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular admin of iodinated contrast materials. Elderly. Monitor renal function regularly. Because of possibility of hypoglycemia in combination therapy with a sulphonylurea or insulin, diabetic control should be monitored by blood sugar readings.

Mode of action: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.ACI	Politor 500 TAB dr   30's pack 270.90

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: Dosage of this preparation must be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Pioglitazone 45 mg and Metformin 2550 mg.  

It may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.

The initial and maintenance dose of  it should be carefully selected in patients with advanced age due to the potential for decreased renal function in these populations. 

Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of Metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly.  It should not be initiated if the patients exhibit clinical evidence of active liver disease. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended in all patients prior to initiation of therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin and periodically thereafter. 

Contra-indication: 1. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g. as suggested by serum creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dl in male, >1.4 mg/dl in females or abnormal creatinine clearance), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction and septicemia.
2. Known hypersensitivity to Pioglitazone, Metformin or any other component of this combination.
3. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without coma.

Side effects: Generally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity.

Precaution: Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of insulin. Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases.

Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive this combination.

Mode of action: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: The dosage  should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 8mg/2000 mg (Rosiglitazone/Metformin).

 In Drug-Naive Patients: The recommended starting dose of  is 2 mg/500 mg once or twice daily. 

For patients with HbA1c >11% or FPG>270 mg/dL, a starting dose of 2 mg/500 mg twice daily may be considered. The dose may be increased by increment of 2 mg/500 mg per day to a maximum of 8 mg/2,000 mg per day in divided doses if patients are not adequately controlled after 4 weeks.

For patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy, the usual starting dose  is 4 mg Rosiglitazone (daily dose) plus the dose of Metformin already being taken.

For patients inadequately controlled on Rosiglitazone monotherapy, the usual starting dose is 1000 mg Metformin (daily dose) plus the dose of Rosiglitazone already being taken.

When switching from combination therapy of Rosiglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets, the usual starting dose  is the dose of Rosiglitazone and Metformin already being taken. If additional glycemic control is needed, the daily dose may be increased by increment of 4 mg Rosiglitazone and/or 500 mg Metformin, up to the maximum recommended total daily dose of 8 mg/2000 mg.

Contra-indication: It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by serum creatinine levels .1.5 mg/dl (males), 1.4 mg/dl (females), or abnormal creatinine clearance), acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma & known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone maleate or metformin HCl.

Side effects: Rosiglitazone: The commonly reported adverse events are upper respiratory tract infections, injury, headache, back pain, fatigue, sinusitis, diarrhoea and hypoglycemia. There were a small number of patients who had anemia and edema. All these events were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment with Rosiglitazone.
Metformin: Some patients may develop asymptomatic subnormal levels of serum vitamin B12.
Incidence of lactic acidosis is also very rare. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, flatulence and anorexia are common reactions to Metformin.

Precaution: Rosiglitazone: should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. This should be used with caution in patients with edema. Dose-related weight gain was seen with rosiglitazone alone and rosiglitazone together with other hypoglycemic agents.

Metformin: Monitoring of renal function: Patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal should not receive this tablet. In patients with advanced age, the dose should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. 

Mode of action: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control.

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: Dose of this combination should be individualized on the basis of the patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg Sitagliptin and 2000 mg Metformin.

Sitagliptin/Metformin combination should generally be given twice daily with meals, with gradual dose escalation, to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to Metformin. 

The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with Metformin is 50 mg Sitagliptin/500 mg Metformin hydrochloride twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin.

The starting dose in patients already treated with Metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of Metformin already being taken. 

For patients taking Metformin 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of this combination is 50 mg Sitagliptin/1000 mg Metformin hydrochloride twice daily. May adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg Sitagliptin and 2000 mg Metformin extended release. Administer once daily with a meal preferably in the evening. Gradually escalate the dose to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to Metformin. 

Maintain the same total daily dose of Sitagliptin and Metformin when changing between Sitagliptin + Metformin ER, without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 2000 mg Metformin extended release.


Contra-indication: • Renal dysfunction, e.g., serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL [males], >1.4 mg/dL [females] or abnormal creatinine clearance.• Metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis.• History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Sitagliptin + Metformin or to one of its components. 

Side effects: Headache, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis. Angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis, hypoglycaemia.

Precaution: Do not use the combination of Sitagliptin & Metformin in patients with hepatic disease. Before initiating the combination and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function and verify as normal. May need to discontinue the combination and temporarily use insulin during periods of stress and decreased intake of fluids and food as may occur with fever, trauma, infection or surgery.

Mode of action: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control.

Dose: Adults: Based on the patient's current dose of Metformin, Combination of Vildagliptin & Metformin may be initiated at either 50 mg/500 mg or 50 mg/850 mg twice daily, 1 tab in the morning and the other in the evening. 

The recommended daily dose is 100 mg Vildagliptin plus 2000 mg Metformin HCl. Patients receiving Vildagliptin and Metformin from separate tablets may be switched to Combination of Vildagliptin & Metformin containing the same doses of each component. Doses higher than 100 mg of Vildagliptin are not recommended. There is no clinical experience of Vildagliptin and Metformin in triple combination with other antidiabetic agents. 

Taking Combination of Vildagliptin & Metformin with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Metformin.


Contra-indication: This combination is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vildagliptin or Metformin Hydrochloride or to any of the excipients. It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, and septicaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure patients and in patients with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. It should be temporarily discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials, because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function.

Side effects: Hypoglycaemia, delayed gastric emptying, nausea and vomiting. Flu-like symptoms, headache and dizziness may occur.
Potentially Fatal: Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Precaution: Lactic acidosis can occur due to Metformin accumulation. If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be hospitalized immediately. 

Patients with renal impairment:
This combination should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction, e.g. serum creatinine levels > 1.5 mg/dL (>135 micro mol/L) in males and > 1.4 mg/dL (>110 micro mol/L) in females.

	Indication: Psoriasis, Vitiligo, Eczema, T-Cell Lymphoma

Dose: For topical solution dosage form:

For vitiligo:  Adults and children 12 years of age and over—Apply to the affected area of the skin and allow to dry for one to two minutes, then apply again within two to two and one-half hours before UVA exposure.

Methoxsalen lotion is applied only in small well-defined lesions and preferably on lesions that can be protected by clothing or sunscreen from later exposure to UVA.

Do not sunbathe for 24 hours before taking methoxsalen and having the UVA light treatment.Take this medication by mouth with food or milk, usually 2 to 4 hours before your UVA light treatment or as directed by your doctor. 

The dosage of methoxsalen is based on  weight, medical condition, and response to treatment. The amount and time of UVA light for each treatment is based on  skin type and response to treatment. patient may have UVA light treatments 2 to 4 times a week when first start and then less frequently as  condition improves.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Nausea or trouble sleeping may occur with methoxsalen. Mild itching/drying/reddening/darkening of skin may occur when methoxsalen is used along with UVA light treatment.

Unlikely but serious side effects occur: severe reddening of skin, blistering/peeling/burning of skin, thinning/wrinkling skin, painful browning/whitening/yellowing of nails, swelling ankles, mental/mood changes (such as depression, nervousness).

Precaution: For the treatment of psoriasis, this medication should only be used for severe psoriasis that has not responded well to other treatments since this medication may cause serious side effects (such as cataracts, skin cancer/aging).

Patients must not sunbathe during the 24 hours prior to methoxsalen ingestion and UV exposure. The presence of a sunburn may prevent an accurate evaluation of the patient's response to photochemotherapy.

Mode of action: Additive effects with drugs known to cause photosensitisation e.g. anthralin, coal tar or derivatives, griseofulvin, phenothiazines, nalidixic acid, sulfonamides., tetracyclines and thiazide diuretics. May increase the levels/effects of aminophylline, fluvoxamine, mexiletine, mirtazapine, ropinirole, theophylline, trifluoperazine, dexmedetomidine and ifosfamide.

	Indication: Anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease

Dose: Anemia Associated with Chronic Renal Failure

Do not increase dose more frequently than q4weeks; decreases in dose can occur more frequently; avoid frequent dose adjustments

If hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., > 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce dose by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses

For patients who do not respond adequately, if hemoglobin has not increased by >1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase dose by 25%

For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing Mircera dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks; use lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce need for RBC transfusions; evaluate other causes of anemia; discontinue Mircera if responsiveness does not improve

Patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis

    Initiate Mircera treatment when hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL
    If hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt dose of Mircera
    Dose if not currently on ESA therapy: 0.6 mcg/kg IV/SC q2week initially 
    Once hemoglobin has been stabilized, dose may be administered once monthly using a dose that is twice that of every-two-week dose and subsequently titrated as necessary

Patients with chronic renal failure not on dialysis

    Consider initiating treatment only when hemoglobin level is < 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply. Rate of hemoglobin decline indicates likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and reducing risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal

    If hemoglobin level >10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt dose, and use lowest dose sufficient to reduce need for RBC transfusions
    Dose if not currently on ESA therapy: 0.6 mcg/kg IV/SC q2week initially 
    Once hemoglobin has been stabilized, Mircera may be administered once monthly using a dose that is twice that of the every-two-week dose and subsequently titrated as necessary

Dose: The initial dosage of parenterally administered Methyl Prednisolone Acetate will vary from 4 to 120 mg, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.

It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

A. Administration for Local Effect

1. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis. The dose for intra-articular administration depends upon the size of the joint and varies with the severity of the condition in the individual patient. In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection. The doses in the following table are given as a general guide:

Large Joint: Knees, Ankles & Shoulders:	20 to 80 mg
Medium joint: Elbows & Wrists:	 10 to 40 mg
Small joint:  Metacarpophalangeal, Interphalangeal, Sternoclavicular & Acromioclavicular:  4 to 10 mg

2. The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 to 30 mg. In recurrent or chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.

3. Injections for Local Effect in Dermatologic Conditions. Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 to 60 mg of the suspension is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. 

B. Administration for Systemic Effect

The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of methylprednisolone tablets is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. The recommended dosage may be reduced for pediatric patients, but dosage should be governed by the severity of the condition rather than by strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.

Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks. Similarly, in patients with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks.

If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.


Contra-indication: Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents.

Intramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route.

Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions

Precaution: General

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Karposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

Dose: This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation.

When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours.

In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.

In other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.

It should be emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. 
If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

To prepare solutions for intravenous infusion, first prepare the solution for injection as directed. This solution may then be added to indicate amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.


Contra-indication: Powder is also contraindicated in systemic fungal infections and patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents. Intramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route. Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions

Side effects: The following adverse reactions have been reported with methylprednisolone acetate or other corticosteroids: Allergic Reactions Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema. Cardiovascular Bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, circulatory collapse, congestive heart failure, fat embolism, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopthy in premature infants, myocardial rupture following recent mycocardial infarction , pulmonary edema, syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis. Dermatologic Acne, allergic dermatitis, cutaneous and subcutaneous atrophy, dry scaly skin, ecchymoses and petechiae, edema, erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, impaired wound healing, increase sweating, rash, sterile abscess, striae, suppressed reactions to skin tests, thin fragile skin, thinning scalp hair, urticaria. 

Endocrine Decreased carbohydrate and glucose tolerance, development of cushingoid state, glycosuria, hirsutism, hypertrichosis, increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetes, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, menstrual irregularities, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness (particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery, or illness), suppression of growth in pediatric patients. Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances Congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, Fluid retention, hypokalemic alkalosis, potassium loss, sodium retention. 

Gastrointestinal Abdominal distention, bowel/bladder dysfunction (after intrathecal administration), elevation in serum liver enzymes levels (usually reversible upon discontinuation), hepatomegaly, increased appetite, nausea, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer with possible subsequent perforation and hemorrhage, perforation of the small and large intestine (particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease), ulcerative esophagitis. 

Musculoskeletal Aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, calcinosis (following intra-articular or intra-lesional use), Charcot-like arthropathy, loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, pathologic fracture of long bones, postinjection flare (following intra-articular use), steroid myopathy, tendon rupture, vertebral compression fractures. Neurologic/Psychiatric Convulsions, depression, emotional instability, euphoria, headache, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri) usually following discontinuation of treatment, insomnia, mood swings, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia, personality changes, psychic disorders, vertigo. Ophthalmic Exophthalmoses, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts. 

Precaution: General The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Karposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency;  hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis.

Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:Indication: Cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy, Foods and water treatment

Dose: The recommended dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing for adult patients is 32 tablets (48 grams of sodium phosphate) taken orally with a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids in the following manner: 

The evening before the colonoscopy procedure: Take 4 monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets with 8 ounces of clear liquids every 15 minutes for a total of 20 tablets.                     

On the day of the colonoscopy procedure: Starting 3-5 hours before the procedure, take 4 monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets with 8 ounces of clear liquids every 15 minutes for a total of 12 tablets. 

Patients should be advised of the importance of taking the recommended fluid regimen. It is recommended that patients receiving monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets be advised to adequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets.  

Patients should not use monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing within seven days of previous administration. No additional enema or laxative is required, and patients should be advised NOT to take additional agents, particularly those containing sodium phosphate

Contra-indication: Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with biopsy-proven acute phosphate nephropathy.

Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to sodium phosphate salts or any of its ingredients.

Side effects: Abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported with the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Dizziness and headache were reported less frequently. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, diarrhea was not defined as an adverse event in the clinical studies. Table 2 shows the most common adverse events associated with the use of 48 grams of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, 60 grams of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, and 60 grams of Visicol in the colon preparation trials (n=931).

Precaution: Patients should be instructed to drink 8 ounces of clear liquids with each 4-tablet dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Patients should take a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids with monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Inadequate fluid intake, as with any effective purgative, may lead to excessive fluid loss, hypovolemia, and dehydration. Dehydration from purgation may be exacerbated by inadequate oral fluid intake, vomiting, and/or use of diuretics.

Patients should be instructed not to administer additional laxative or purgative agents, particularly additional sodium phosphate-based purgative or enema products.

Prolongation of the QT interval has been observed in some patients who were dosed with sodium phosphate colon preparations. QT prolongation with sodium phosphate tablets has been associated with electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, since serious complications may occur. Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients with known prolonged QT.

Administration of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets may induce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, since this endoscopic finding was observed with other sodium phosphate cathartic preparations. In the monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets clinical program, aphthous ulcers were observed in 3% of patients who took the 48 gram monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets dosing regimen. This colonoscopic finding should be considered in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.

Because published data suggest that sodium phosphate absorption may be enhanced in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in such patients.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:Renata	Deltasone N Eye/Ear Drops   5  ml drop 39.98
	Indication: Bacterial ocular infection, otitis externa

Dose:  Instill 1 or 2 drops every 3 or 4 hours, or more frequently as required. Acute infections may require administration every 30 minutes, with frequency of administration reduced as the infection is brought under control. 



Contra-indication: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of the ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication. (Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components.)

The use of these combinations is always contraindicated after uncomplicated removal of a corneal foreign body.

Side effects: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available since no denominator of treated patients is available.

Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredients are allergic sensitizations including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . More serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. The reactions due to the steroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.

Although systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical steroids.

Corticosteroid-containing preparations have also been reported to cause perforation of the globe. Keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and conjunctival hyperemia have occasionally been reported following local use of steroids.

Secondary infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used.

Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.

Precaution: The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 20 milliliters should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.

The possibility of persistent fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged steroid dosing.

As with other antimicrobial preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated.

 . If purulent discharge, inflammation, or pain becomes aggravated, the patient should discontinue use of the medicatioin and consult a physician.

Allergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.

Mode of action: Synergistic effects with penicillins. Additive toxicity with neurotoxic, ototoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. May decrease absorption of digoxin and methotrexate. May increase effects of oral anticoagulants.

Contra-indication: Niacin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Niacin or any component of this medication, significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction, active peptic ulcer disease or arterial bleeding.

Side effects: Niacin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions have been mild and transient.The most frequent advers effects were flushing, itching, pruritis, nausea and GI upset, jaundice ,hypotension, tachycardia, increased serum blood glucose and uric acid levels, myalgia.

Precaution: Before instituting therapy with Niacin, an attempt should be made to control hyperlipidemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients and to treat other underlying medical problems. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during Niacin therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in glucose intolerance, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary.

Caution should also be used when Niacin is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers or adrenergic blocking agents. Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with Niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count and increases in prothrombin time. Caution should be observed when Niacin is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time and platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). So phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk.

Precaution: 1. General

Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.
2. Physical Examination and Follow-Up

A periodic personal and family medical history and complete physical examination are appropriate for all women, including women using oral contraceptives. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.
3. Lipid Disorders

Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.


4. Liver Function

If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.
5. Fluid Retention

Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.
6. Emotional Disorders

Patients becoming significantly depressed while taking oral contraceptives should stop the medication and use an alternate method of contraception in an attempt to determine whether the symptom is drug-related. Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a significant degree.
7. Contact Lenses

Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.
8. Gastrointestinal

Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption resulting in decreased serum concentrations

Precaution: Impaired renal, hepatic, cardiovascular function; prostatic hypertrophy; paralytic ileus; DM; parkinsonism; pregnancy. History of blood dyscrasias, myelosuppression, seizures; dementia; dyslipidaemia. IM: Hypotension, bradyarrhythmia, hypoventilation; monitor BP carefully. Caution when used in adolescents due to increased risk of weight gain and hyperlipidaemia. Efficacy and safety have not been established in paediatric patients <13 yr.

Mode of action: Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Drugs that induce CYP1A2 or glucuronyl transferase enzymes e.g. omeprazole and rifampicin, may increase olanzapine clearance. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 may potentially inhibit olanzapine elimination. Carbamazepine may increase the clearance of olanzapine. Concomitant admin of activated charcoal reduced the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50-60%. Caution should be taken when olanzapine is administered with centrally acting drugs and alcohol.

	Indication: Severe allergic asthma

Dose: Adult: SC Dose depends on patients wt and pre-treatment serum IgE levels. Dose may range from 75-300 mg 4 wkly to 225-375 mg 2 wkly. Not >150 mg/inj site.

Contra-indication: Previous severe hypersensitivity reaction, acute bronchospasm, status asthmaticus.

Side effects: Headache; upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis; viral infection; pain, fatigue, dizziness; dermatitis, pruritus; arthralgia; earache; inj site reaction.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions including bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, dyspnoea and/or angioedema of the throat or tongue.

Precaution: Children <12 yr; pregnancy; lactation; patients at risk for parasitic infections. Corticosteriod therapy should not be stopped abruptly. Delayed-onset anaphylaxis has been reported; reactions usually occur within 2 hr of admin, but may occur up to 24 hr to >1 yr after initiation of regular treatment. Treatment should only be under direct medical supervision and be observed for a min of 2 hr following admin. May increase risk of malignancy in some patients.

Mode of action: Cytochrome P-450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions. No formal drug or vaccine interaction studies have been performed with Omalizumab. There is no pharmacological reason to expect that commonly prescribed medications used in the treatment of asthma will interact with omalizumab.

In clinical studies, Omalizumab was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, inhaled short- and long-acting beta-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral antihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of Omalizumab was altered with these other commonly used asthma medications. Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in combination with specific immunotherapy (hyposensitisation therapy).

Omalizumab may indirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other parasitic infections.
Incompatibilities: Omalizumab should not be mixed with any medication or diluents other than water for injections.

	Indication: Postpartum haemorrhage, Labour induction, Abortion, Facilitate lactation

Dose: Intravenous
Adjunct in abortion
Adult: 10-20 milliunits/minute. Max total dose: 30 units in a 12-hr period.

Postpartum haemorrhage
Adult: 10-40 units by infusion in 1000 mL of IV fluid at a rate sufficient to control uterine atony.

Labour induction
Adult: 1-2 milliunits/minute, may increase at intervals of at least 30 minutes until a max of 3-4 contractions occur every 10 minutes. Not to exceed 32 milliunits/minute and no more than a total of 5 units should be given in 1 day. Not to be given within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Monitor uterine contractions and foetal heart rate continuously. Withdraw gradually once labour is progressing.

Oxytocin challenge test for evaluating of foetal distress
Adult: Dilute 5-10 units in 1 L of 5% dextrose inj. Initially, administer the drug in the mother via IV infusion at a rate of 0.5 milliunits/minute. May gradually increase infusion rate at intervals of 15-30 minutes. Max: 20 milliunits/minute. Monitor foetal heart rate and uterine contractions immediately before and during infusion. Discontinue infusion when 3 moderate uterine contractions occur within one 10-minute interval. Compare baseline and oxytocin-induced foetal heart rates. If no change occurs, repeat the test in 1 wk. Termination of pregnancy may be required if a late deceleration in foetal heart rate occurs.

Contra-indication: Cephalopelvic disproportion; abnormal presentation of the foetus; hydraminios; multiparae; previous caesarian section or other uterine surgery; hyperactive or hypertonic uterus, uterine rupture; contraindicated vaginal delivery (invasive cervical cancer, active genital herpes, prolapse of the cord, cord presentation, total placenta previa or vasa previa); foetal distress where delivery is not imminent; severe pre-eclamptic toxaemia.

Side effects: Foetus or neonate: Jaundice; arrhythmias, bradycardia; brain, CNS damage; seizure; retinal haemorrhage; low Apgar score. Mother: transient hypotension, reflex tachycardia; nasal irritation, rhinorrhoea, lachrymation (following nasal admin); uterine bleeding, violent contractions, hypertonicity; spasm; nausea, vomiting.
Potentially Fatal: Maternal water intoxication (especially with slow infusion over 24 hr); prolonged uterine contractions causing foetal hypoxia and death; rupture of gravid uterus; afibrinogenaemia; subarachnoid haemorrhage

Precaution: CV disorders; >35 yr; lactation. Monitor foetal and maternal heart rate, maternal BP and uterine motility. Monitor fluid intake and output during treatment. Discontinute immediately if the uterus is hypertonic or hyperactive or if there is foetal distress. Use of nasal spray may produce maternal dependence on its effects. IM admin not regularly used due to unpredictable effects of oxytocin. Not to be used for prolonged periods in resistant uterine inertia, severe pre-eclampsia, or severe CV disorders. Risk of water intoxication when used at high doses for prolonged periods.

Mode of action: Possible severe hypertension if given within 3-4 hr of vasoconstrictor in association with a caudal block anaesthesia. Cyclopropane anaesthesia may increase risk of hypotension and maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal AV rhythms. Dinoprostone and misoprostol may increase uterotonic effect of oxytocin, thus oxytocin should not be used within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Concurrent use may increase the vasopressor effect of sympathomimetics.

Potentially Fatal: Concomitant use with prostaglandins increases risk of uterine rupture and cervical lacerations.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Possible severe hypertension if given within 3-4 hr of vasoconstrictor in association with a caudal block anaesthesia. Cyclopropane anaesthesia may increase risk of hypotension and maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal AV rhythms.

Pregnancy and lactation. In kaposi's sarcoma, contraindicated in patients with concurrent, serious, uncontrolled infections.


Side effects: Neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, bleeding; hypersensitivity reactions (dyspnoea, flushing, chest pain, tachycardia, rash, hypotension, hypertension); bradycardia, abnormal ECG; neurotoxicity (mainly peripheral neuropathy), myalgia, arthralgia; nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea; severe mucositis, alopecia; rarely hepatic necrosis and encephalopathy, inj site reactions e.g. erythema, tenderness, skin discolouration, swelling; interstitial pneumonitis; infections (mainly UTIs and upper respiratory tract); mucosal inflammation, severe elevation in LFTs (aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase).
Potentially Fatal: Infections and infestations leading to death e.g. pneumonia and peritonitis.

Precaution:  	Bone marrow suppression during therapy. Monitor cardiac function if conduction abnormalities result. Premedicaton (with corticosteroid, antihistamine and histamine H2-receptor antagonist) may be required to reduce risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue, if severe reactions e.g. hypotension, dyspnoea, angioedema or urticaria occur. Caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor for reactions of admin. Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients have not been established. Administer before platinum derivatives (cisplatin, carboplatin) if used in combination. Hazardous agent; use appropriate precautions for handling and disposal.


Mode of action: Myelosuppression was more profound when given after cisplatin than with the alternate sequence (e.g., paclitaxel before cisplatin). CYP2C8 inducers e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifapentine, and secobarbital may reduce levels or effects. CYP2C8 inhibitors e.g. gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, montelukast, and ritonavir may increase levels or effects. CYP3A4 inducers e.g. aminoglutethimide, carbamazepine, nafcillin, nevirapine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifamycins may decrease the levels or effects. 

CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g. azole antifungals, clarithromycin, diclofenac, doxycycline, erythromycin, imatinib, isoniazid, nefazodone, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine, telithromycin, and verapamil may increase levels or effects. May increase anthracycline (eg doxorubicin, epirubicin) levels or toxicity; admin of anthracycline at least 24 hr prior to paclitaxel may reduce interaction. May decrease the absorption of cardiac glycosides (may only affect digoxin tablets); levels should be monitored.

Dose: Adult Dose

Up to 50 mL of  (hydroxyethyl starch in sodium chloride injection) per kg of body weight per day (equivalent to 3 g hydroxyethyl starch and 7.7 mEq sodium per kg of body weight). This dose is equivalent to 3500 mL of  (hydroxyethyl starch in sodium chloride injection) for a 70 kg patient.
Pediatric Dose



Contra-indication:     Known hypersensitivity to hydroxyethyl starch 
    fluid overload (hyperhydration) and especially in 

cases of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure
    renal failure with oliguria or anuria not related 

to hypovolemia
    patients receiving dialysis treatment
    severe hypernatremia or severe hyperchloremia
    intracranial bleeding.


Side effects: From the accumulated clinical development experience, 

expected adverse reactions after administration of 

 (hydroxyethyl starch in sodium chloride injection) occurring in less than 10% of patients are as follows:

Immune system disorders (Rare, > 0.01% to < 0.1%): 

anaphylactoid reactions (hypersensitivity, mild influenza-like symptoms, bradycardia, tachycardia, bronchospasm, non-cardiac pulmonary edema). In the event of an intolerance reaction, the infusion should be discontinued immediately and the appropriate emergency medical treatment initiated. 

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (Common, > 1 to < 10%, dose dependent): Prolonged administration of high dosages of hydroxyethyl starch may cause pruritus (itching) which is an undesirable effect observed with all hydroxyethyl starches.



Precaution: Anaphylactoid reactions (mild influenza-like symptoms, 

bradycardia, tachycardia, bronchospasm, non-cardiac 

pulmonary edema) have been reported with solutions 

containing hydroxyethyl starch. If a hypersensitivity 

reaction occurs, administration of the drug should be 

discontinued immediately and the appropriate treatment 

and supportive measures should be undertaken until 

symptoms have resolved. 

Fluid status and rate of infusion should be assessed 

regularly during treatment, especially in patients with 

cardiac insufficiency or severe kidney dysfunction.

In cases of severe dehydration, a crystalloid solution 

should be given first. Generally, sufficient fluid 

should be administered in order to avoid dehydration.

Caution should be observed before administering 

(hydroxyethyl starch in sodium chloride 

injection) to patients with severe liver disease or 

severe bleeding disorders (e.g., severe cases of von 

Willebrand´s disease).

Usual Adult Dose for Prevention of Hypokalemia.

Oral:
10 to 20 mEq orally once a day given in equally divided doses using formulations which include normal-release tablets or capsules, extended-release tablets or capsules, dissolvable tablets, oral solution or powder for dissolution mixed with an appropriate volume of water or juice.
Usual Pediatric Dose for Hypokalemia

Treatment of hypokalemia: Note: High variability exists in dosing/infusion rate recommendations; therapy should be guided by patient condition and specific institutional guidelines.

Infants and Children:

Oral: 2 to 5 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; not to exceed 1 to 2 mEq/kg as a single dose; if deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, IV route should be considered preferred route of administration.

Normal daily requirements: Oral or IV:
Infants: 2 to 6 mEq/kg/day
Children: 2 to 3 mEq/kg/day

Prevention of hypokalemia during diuretic therapy:
Infants and Children: 1 to 2 mEq/kg/day orally in 1 to 2 divided doses

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Metabolic

Metabolic side effects have been reported rarely and have usually resulted from hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia is relatively high in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

Gastrointestinal

Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects have been reported from orally administered potassium chloride. They have included bad taste or aftertaste, nausea (10% to 30%), abdominal pain (20%), diarrhea (25%), dyspepsia or "heartburn" (5% to 20%) and GI ulceration. They have rarely included gastric or small bowel obstruction associated with the use of solid preparations.

All solid KCl preparations can cause erosive damage to the GI mucosa, especially when they are administered in high doses with an anticholinergic agent. Anticholinergic agents increase GI transit (and potassium-mucosa contact) time.

Patients at higher risk of GI lesions include the elderly, the immobile and those with scleroderma, diabetes mellitus, mitral valve replacement, cardiomegaly or esophageal stricture. 

Nearly half of all patients complain of a bad taste or aftertaste.

Liquid KCl may be a better choice for patients with a history of esophageal stenosis or left atrial enlargement.

Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity side effects have been reported rarely. They have included a single case of contact dermatitis.
Dermatologic

Dermatologic side effects have rarely included skin rash.

Precaution: Potassium chloride (KCl) is contraindicated in the presence of hyperkalemia; renal failure and conditions in which potassium retention is present, including the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (such as triamterene, amiloride, or spironolactone); oliguria or azotemia; anuria; crush syndrome; severe hemolytic reactions; adrenocortical insufficiency (untreated Addison's disease); adynamical episodica hereditaria; acute dehydration; heat cramps; and early postoperative oliguria except during gastrointestinal drainage.

Patients should not use potassium-rich salt substitutes without the advice of their healthcare professional during KCl therapy.

In patients with renal insufficiency, use of potassium chloride may cause potassium intoxication and life-threatening hyperkalemia.

Solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride can produce ulcerative and/or stenotic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. Potassium chloride should be discontinued immediately and the possibility of ulceration, obstruction, or perforation should be considered if severe vomiting, abdominal pain, distention, or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs.

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory evaluations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the administration of additional electrolyte supplements, or the administration of electrolyte-free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added.

Certain potassium chloride extended-release tablets contain a wax matrix. This matrix is not absorbed and is excreted in the feces. In some instances the empty matrices may be noticeable in the stool.

Dose selection in the elderly should be cautious and should start at the lower end of the dosing range.

	Popular	P-caine Eye Drops 0.5% 10 ml plastic dropper bottle 
	Indication: Corneal anesthesia, Foreign Bodies & Suture Removal

Dose: Deep anesthesia as in cataract extraction:

Instill 1 drop every 5 to 10 minutes for 5 to 7 doses.

Removal of sutures:

Instill 1 or 2 drops 2 or 3 minutes before removal of stitches.

Removal of foreign bodies:

Instill 1 or 2 drops prior to operating.

Tonometry:

Instill 1 or 2 drops immediately before measurement.


Contra-indication: This preparation is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the solution. This product should never be prescribed for the patient's own use.

Side effects: Pupillary dilatation or cycloplegic effects have rarely been observed with proparacaine hydrochloride. The drug appears to be safe for use in patients sensitive to other local anesthetics, but local or systemic sensitivity occasionally occurs. Instillation of proparacaine in the eye at recommended concentration and dosage usually produces little or no initial irritation, stinging, burning, conjunctival redness, lacrimation or increased winking. However, some local irritation and stinging may occur several hours after the instillation. Rarely, a severe immediate-type, apparently hyperallergic corneal reaction may occur which includes acute, intense and diffuse epithelial keratitis; a gray, ground-glass appearance; sloughing of large areas of necrotic epithelium; corneal filaments and, sometimes, iritis with descemetitis. Allergic contact dermatitis with drying and fissuring of the fingertips has been reported. Softening and erosion of the corneal epithelium and conjunctival congestion and hemorrhage have been reported.

Precaution: Proparacaine hydrochloride should be used cautiously and sparingly in patients with known allergies, cardiac disease, or hyperthyroidism. The long-term toxicity of proparacaine is unknown, prolonged use may possibly delay wound healing. Although exceedingly rare with ophthalmic application of local anesthetics, it should be borne in mind that systemic toxicity (manifested by central nervous system stimulation followed by depression) may occur. Protection of the eye from irritating chemicals, foreign bodies and rubbing during the period of anesthesia is very important. Tonometers soaked in sterilizing or detergent solutions should be thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water prior to use. Patients should be advised to avoid touching the eye until the anesthesia has worn off.

Dose: Adults
Hypertension: As starting dose of 80mg twice a day may increased at weekly intervals according to response. The usual dose range is 160-320mg per day. With concurrentdiuretic or other antihypertensive drugs a further reduction of blood pressure is obtained.

Angina, anxiety,migraine and essential tremor:
A staring dose of 40mg two or three times daily may be increased by the same amount at weekly intervals according to patients’ response. An adequate response in anxiety, migraine and essential tremor is usually seen in the range 80-160mg/day and an angina in the range 120-240mg/day.

Situational and generalized anxiety:
A dose of 40mg daily may provide short term relief of acute situational anxiety.
Generalized anxiety require long term therapy, usually responds adequately to 40mg twice daily which, which individual cases, may be increased to 40mg three times daily. Treatment should be continued according to responses. Patients shouldreviewed after 6 to12 months treatment.

Dysarhythmias, anxiety tachycardia, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and thyrotoxicosis:
A dosage range of 10-40mg three or four times a day usually achieves the required response.

Post myocardial infarction:Treatment should be started between days 5 and after 21 after myocardial infarction,with an initial dose of 40mg four times a day for 2 or 3 days. In order to improve compliance the total daily doses three after be given as 80mg twice a day.

Phaeochromocytoma (Used only with an alpha receptor blocking drug).
Pre-operative: 60mg daily for three days. Non-operable malignant cases: 30mg daily.

Children: Sysrhythmias, Phaeochromocytoma,Thyrotoxicisis: Dosage should be individually determined and the following is only a guide.0.25-0.5mg/kg three or four times daily as required.

Migraine Under 12 years: 20mg two or three times daily.
Over 12 years: The adult dose.

As Extended release Capsule:
Hypertension
Dosage Must Be Individualized. The usual initial dosage is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased to 120 mg once daily or higher until adequate blood pressure control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage is 120 to 160 mg once daily. In some instances a dosage of 640 mg may be required. The time needed for full hypertensive response to a given dosage is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks.

Angina Pectoris

Dosage Must Be Individualized. Starting with 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily, dosage should be gradually increased at three- to seven-day intervals until optimal response is obtained. Although individual patients may respond at any dosage level, the average optimal dosage appears to be 160 mg once daily. In angina pectoris, the value and safety of dosage exceeding 320 mg per day have not been established.

If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce dosage gradually over a period of a few weeks.

Migraine
Dosage Must Be Individualized. The initial oral dose is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily. The usual effective dose range is 160 to 240 mg once daily. The dosage may be increased gradually to achieve optimal migraine prophylaxis. If a satisfactory response is not obtained within four to six weeks after reaching the maximal dose, propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules therapy should be discontinued.

Dose: 1g triglycerides corresponds to 10 ml Intralipid 10%.

Adults. The recommended maximum dosage is 3 g triglycerides/kg body weight/day. Within this upper limit, Intralipid can be given to contribute up to 70% of the energy requirements, also in patients with highly increased energy requirements. The infusion rate for Intralipid 10% should not exceed 500 ml in 5 hours.

Neonates and infants. The recommended dosage range in neonates and infants is 0.5-4 g triglycerides/ kg bw/day. The rate of infusion should not exceed 0.17 g triglycerides/kg bw/hour (4 g in 24 hours). In prematures and low birthweight neonates, Intralipid should preferably be infused continuously over 24 hours. The initial dosage should be 0.5-1 g/kg bw/day followed by a successive increase by 0.5-1 g/kg bw/day up to 2g/kg bw/day. Only with close monitoring of serum triglyceride concentration, liver tests and oxygen saturation may the dosage be increased to 4 g/kg bw/day. The rates given are maximum rates and no attempt should be made to exceed these in order to compensate for missed doses.

Contra-indication: Intralipid is contraindicated in patients with acute shock and in patients with severe hyperlipemia. Severe liver insufficiency. Hemophagocytotic syndrome. Hypersensitivity to egg-, soya- or peanut protein or to any of the active substances or excipients.

Side effects: Intralipid infusion may cause a rise in body temperature and, less frequently, shivering, chills and nausea/vomiting (incidence<1%).

Precaution: Intralipid should be given with caution in conditions of impaired lipid metabolism as in renal insufficiency, uncompensated diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, impaired liver function, hypothyroidism (if hypertri-glyceridemic) and sepsis. If Intralipid is given to patients with these conditions, close monitoring of the serum triglyceride concentration is obligatory.

This medicinal product contains soya-bean oil and egg phospholipids, which may rarely cause allergic reactions. Cross allergic reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut.

Intralipid should be given with caution to neonates and prematures with hyperbilirubinemia and cases with suspected pulmonary hypertension. In neonates, particularly prematures on long term parenteral nutrition, platelet count, liver tests and serum triglyceride concentration should be monitored.

Intralipid may interfere with certain laboratory measurements (bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, oxygen saturation, Hb etc) if blood is sampled before fat has been adequately cleared from the blood stream. Fat is cleared after a fat free interval of 5-6 hours in most patients.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Cardiovascular

Cardiovascular side effects have included elevations of heart rate and blood pressure. In smaller doses, racepinephrine has caused peripheral coronary arterial vasodilation, but in larger doses, racepinephrine has caused diffuse vasoconstriction. This has caused increased peripheral vascular resistance, which was important in patients with coronary artery disease (worsened myocardial ischemia/angina) or hypertension (risk of emergent hypertension/stroke).

Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in patients with underlying cardiac disease. Rapid rises in blood pressure have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Angina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease.
Gastrointestinal

Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea and vomiting.
Nervous system

Nervous system side effects have included fear, agitation, anxiety, tenseness, restlessness, headache, tremor, dizziness, lightheadedness, nervousness, sleeplessness, excitability, weakness, and increased parkinsonian tremors.
Psychiatric

Psychiatric side effects have included agitation, disorientation, impaired memory, aggressive or assautive behavior, hallucinations, and psychosis.

Precaution:  Asthma alert: Because asthma may be life threatening, see a doctor if you:

The maximum recommended daily dose of Ranolazine is 1000 mg twice daily. If a dose of Ranolazine is missed, take the prescribed dose at the next scheduled time; do not double the next dose.

Contra-indication: Taking strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, nelfinavir) Taking inducers of CYP3A (e.g., phenobarbital, rifampicin)Significant hepatic impairment 

Side effects: Cardiac Disorders - bradycardia, palpitationsEar and Labyrinth Disorders - tinnitus, vertigoGastrointestinal Disorders - abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomitingGeneral Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events - peripheral edemaRespiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders - dyspneaVascular Disorders - hypotension, orthostatic hypotension 

Precaution: Heart rhythm problems (e.g., bradycardia, QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia), liver problems, certain uncorrected mineral imbalances (low potassium/magnesium levels), severe kidney problems. 

Mode of action: Increased plasma levels w/ moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. diltiazem, fluconazole, erythromycin), P-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g. verapamil, ciclosporin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine). May increase plasma digoxin concentrations. May increase risk of rhabdomyolysis w/ simvastatin. May increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, other statins (e.g. lovastatin) and CYP3A4 substrates w/ narrow therapeutic range (e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus). May increase plasma exposure of metformin. Increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias w/ other drugs that prolong QT interval (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine).

Potentially Fatal: Increased plasma concentrations leading to increased adverse effects w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone). Decreased plasma concentration w/ CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine). Increased risk of QT interval prolongation w/ class 1A (e.g. quinidine) or class III (e.g. dofetilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmics other than amiodarone.

Pregnancy category: C

May increase plasma digoxin concentrations. May increase risk of rhabdomyolysis w/ simvastatin. May increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, other statins (e.g. lovastatin) and CYP3A4 substrates w/ narrow therapeutic range (e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus). May increase plasma exposure of metformin. Increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias w/ other drugs that prolong QT interval (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole, mizolastine).

Potentially Fatal: Increased plasma concentrations leading to increased adverse effects w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone). Decreased plasma concentration w/ CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine). Increased risk of QT interval prolongation w/ class 1A (e.g. quinidine) or class III (e.g. dofetilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmics other than amiodarone.Indication: Children's growth disorders, growth hormone deficiency,Turner syndrome, chronic renal failure, Prader-Willi syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation,  severe idiopathic short stature

Dose: Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)

Generally, a dosage of 0.16 to 0.24 mg/kg body weight /week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)

Generally, a dosage of 0.24 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.

Small for Gestational Age (SGA)

Generally, a dosage of up to 0.48 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.

Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS)

Generally, a dose up to 0.47 mg/kg of body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.
Dosing of Adult Patients
Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)

Based on the weight-based dosing utilized in clinical studies with another somatropin product, the recommended dosage at the start of therapy is not more than 0.04 mg/kg/week given as a daily subcutaneous injection. The dose may be increased at 4- to 8-week intervals according to individual patient requirements to not more than 0.08 mg/kg/week. Clinical response, side effects, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-I levels may be used as guidance in dose titration.

Alternatively, taking into account recent literature, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15-0.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight. This dose can be increased gradually every 1-2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF-I concentrations. During therapy, the dose should be decreased if required by the occurrence of adverse events and/or serum IGF-I levels above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person.

A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men. Oral estrogen administration may increase the dose requirements in women.

Contra-indication:     Acute Critical Illness
    Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome who are severely obese or have severe respiratory impairment—reports of sudden death
    Active Malignancy

Precaution:     Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk
    Prader-Willi Syndrome in children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur
    Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin–in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm
    Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment
    Intracranial Hypertension: Exclude preexisting papilledema. May develop and is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction
    Fluid Retention (i.e., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, especially in adults): May occur frequently. Reduce dose as necessary
    Hypopituitarism: Closely monitor other hormone replacement therapies
    Hypothyroidism: May first become evident or worsen
    Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain
    Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: May develop

Mode of action: Concomitant corticosteroid therapy may inhibit the effect of somatropin. Gonadotropins, oestrogens, androgens & anabolic agents.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Concomitant corticosteroid therapy may inhibit the effect of somatropin. Gonadotropins, oestrogens, androgens & anabolic agents.Indication: Female infertility,  (LH) and FSH deficiency

Dose: Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response. A recommended regimen commences at lutropinalpha 75 IU (ie, 1 vial of Luveris) daily with FSH 75-150 IU.

If an FSH, dose increase is deemed appropriate; dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any 1 cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5000-10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hrs after the last Luveris and FSH injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to gonadotropins or to any of the excipients of Luveris.
Ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma; active, untreated tumors of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland; ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease; gynecological hemorrhages of unknown origin.
Use in pregnancy & lactationThis should not be administered during pregnancy and lactation.

Side effects: General Description: Lutropin alpha is used for the stimulation of follicular development in association with follitropin alpha. In this context, it is difficult to attribute adverse reactions to any one of the substances used.
There is considerable post-marketing safety experience with human luteinizing hormone (hLH)-containing medicinal products of urinary origin. The safety profile of Luveris is expected to be very similar to that of urine-derived hLH, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions and application site disorders.
In a clinical trial, mild and moderate injection site reactions (bruising, pain, redness, itching or swelling) were reported in 7.4% and 0.9% of the injections, respectively. No severe injection site reactions were reported. To date, no systemic allergic reactions have been reported following Luveris administration.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was observed in <6% of patients treated with Luveris. No severe OHSS was reported.
Ectopic pregnancy may also occur, especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.

Precaution: Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
It should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained eg, ovarian failure, malformation of the sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy or fibroid tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.
In addition, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency and hyperprolactinemia and, pituitary or hypothalmic tumors, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing follicular growth stimulation are at increased risk of developing hyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular development.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can become a serious medical event characterised by large ovarian cysts which are prone to rupture. Excessive ovarian response seldom gives rise to significant hyperstimulation unless hCG is administered to induce ovulation. It is therefore prudent to withhold hCG in such cases and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
Careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound is recommended prior to and during stimulation therapy, especially in patients with polycystic ovaries.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.

Mode of action: Luveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except follitropin ? for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.

Incompatibilities: Luveris must not be mixed with other medicinal products except follitropin ?.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction: Luveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except follitropin ? for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.

	Indication:     Parenteral nutrition
    Preoperative and postoperative nutritional disturbances where an improved nitrogen balance is required;
    Nutritional disorders or disturbances of nitrogen balance due to inadequate or failing intestinal absorption caused by tumours in the gastrointestinal tract, acute or chronic intestinal diseases (peritonitis, ulcerative colitis, terminal ileitis);
    Burns, to reduce the frequently excessive nitrogen losses; Prolonged unconsciousness, eg. following cranial trauma or poisoning in cases where enteral feeding is inappropriate or impossible;
    Impaired renal function where a concentrated source of energy may be indicated to reduce protein breakdown;
    Cachexia and Patients with essential fatty acid deficiency who cannot maintain or restore a normal essential fatty acid pattern by oral intake.


Dose: Total Parenteral nutrition: As a part of TPN, administer IV via a peripheral vein or by central venous catheter. Fat emulsion should comprise no more than 60% of the patient's total caloric intake, with carbohydrates and amino acids comprising the remaining 40% or more of caloric intake. 

Adult: Initial infusion rate is 1ml/min for the first 15 to 30 mins. If no adverse reactions occur, the infusion rate can be increased to 2 ml/min. Infuse only 500 ml the first day and increase dose the following day. Do not exceed a daily dosage of 2.5 g/kg. 
Children: Initial infusion rate is 0.1ml/min for the first 10 to 15 mins. If no adverse reactions occur, the infusion rate can be increased to 1g/kg in 4 hours. Do not exceed a daily dosage of 3 g/kg. 
Infants: Starts at 0.5g/kg/24 hours and may be increased in relation to the infant's ability to eliminate fat. The maximum recommended dosage is 3g/kg/24 hours. 
Fatty acid deficiency: To correct EFAD, supply 8% to 10% of the caloric intake by IV fat emulsion to provide an adequate amount of linoleic acid. 

Contra-indication: It is contraindicated in conditions with severely disordered fat metabolism, such as in severe liver damage and acute shock. Hypersensitivity to egg-, soya- or peanut protein or to any of active substances or excipients.

Side effects: This may cause a rise in body temperature (incidence <3%) and, less frequently, shivering, chills and nausea/vomiting (incidence <1%). Reports of other adverse events in conjunction with 10% fat emulsion infusion are extremely rare, less than one report of certain events per one million infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic reaction, skin rash, urticaria), respiratory symptoms (tachypnoea) and circulatory effects (hypertension, hypotension) have been described. 
Thrombosis, haemolysis, reticulocytosis, abdominal pain, tiredness, priapism and neurological adverse reactions including headaches, flushing, dyspnoea, slight pressure over the eyes and dizziness have been reported.

Precaution: This contains soya oil and egg lecithin which may rarely cause allergic reactions. Cross allergic reaction has been observed between soya-bean and peanut. Fat metabolism may be disturbed in conditions such as renal insufficiency, uncompensated diabetes, pancreatitis, certain forms of liver insufficiency, metabolic disorders and sepsis. Fatisol should be administered with caution as a strong correlation exists between C-reactive protein and the agglutination of Fatisol in seriously ill patients. 

It should be given with caution to neonates and premature infants with hyperbilirubinaemia and in cases with suspected pulmonary hypertension. In low birthweight infants, the risk of lipid infusions may outweigh potential benefits due to further diminution of defences against infection. In infants, metabolism of lipids in peripheral tissues may be diminished by infection and heparin administration. In neonates receiving long term parenteral nutrition, particularly premature neonates, platelet count, liver function tests and serum triglyceride concentration should be monitored. Use in Pregnancy & Lactation: Absolute safety of the foetus and the nursing infant has not been established. Therefore,it should be administered with caution during pregnancy and lactation.

Hepatic Impairment: The systemic exposure of Rifaximin was markedly elevated in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects.

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to Rifaximin or to any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any components of this product.

Side effects: Side effects include flatulence, headache, abdominal pain, rectal tenesmus, defecation urgency, nausea, constipation, pyrexia, vomiting. Reactions have been reported, including anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, and exfoliative dermatitis.

Precaution: Rifaximin is not found to be effective in patients with diarrhea complicated by fever and/or blood in the stools. Rifaximin therapy should be discontinued if diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist for more than 24-48 hours and an alternative antibiotic therapy should be considered. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.

Mode of action: Although in vitro studies demonstrated the potential of rifaximin to interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4), a clinical drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that rifaximin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. An additional clinical drug-drug interaction study showed no effect of rifaximin on the presystemic metabolism of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate. Therefore, clinical interactions with drugs metabolized by human cytochrome P450 isozymes are not expected.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity

Side effects:  High doses of fish oil might also reduce the immune system’s activity, reducing the body’s ability to fight infection. This is a special concern for people taking medications to reduce their immune system’s activity (organ transplant patients, for example) and the elderly.

Fish oil can cause side effects including belching, bad breath, heartburn, nausea, loose stools, rash, and nosebleeds. Taking fish oil supplements with meals or freezing them can often decrease these side effects.
Fish or seafood allergy: Some people who are allergic to seafood such as fish might also be allergic to fish oil supplements. There is no reliable information showing how likely people with seafood allergy are to have an allergic reaction to fish oil; however, until more is known advise patients allergic to seafood to avoid or use fish oil supplements cautiously.

Bipolar disorder: Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition.

Depression: Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition.

Diabetes: There is some concern that taking high doses of fish oil might make the control of blood sugar more difficult.

High blood pressure: Fish oil can lower blood pressure and might cause blood pressure to drop too low in people who are being treated with blood pressure-lowering medications.

HIV/AIDS and other conditions in which the immune system response is lowered: Higher doses of fish oil can lower the body’s immune system response. This could be a problem for people whose immune system is already weak.

Familial adenomatous polyposis: There is some concern that fish oil might further increase the risk of getting cancer in people with this condition.

Precaution: Liver disease: Fish oil might increase the risk of bleeding.

	Indication: Cuts, Wounds, Severe burns, Post-operative wound dressing, Bed sores

Dose: Adult: Topical As 1% cream: Apply onto affected area 1-2 times/day.

Burns: The burn wound should be cleaned and  cream applied over all the affected areas to a depth of 3-5mm.  Where necessary, the cream should be re-applied to any area from which it has been removed by patient activity. In burns,  cream should be re-applied at least every 24 hours or more frequently if the volume of exudate is large.

Hand burns: Before application of Sibalyn® cream to the burn, the whole hand should be enclosed in a clear plastic bag or glove . The patient should be encouraged to move the hand and fingers. The dressing should be changed when an excessive amount of exudate has accumulated in the bag.

Leg Ulcers/Pressure Sores: The cavity of the ulcer should be filled with  Cream to a depth of at least 3-5mm. As  Cream can cause maceration of normal skin on prolonged contact, care should be taken to prevent spread onto non-ulcerated areas. Application of Cream should be followed by an absorbent pad or gauze dressing, with further application of pressure bandaging as appropriate for the ulcer.The dressings should normally be changed daily but for wounds which are less exudative, less frequent changes (every 48 hours) may be acceptable. 

Contra-indication: Silver sulfadiazine cream is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitivity to silver sulphonamide or to other components of the preparation such as cetyl alcohol or propylene glycol. Because sulphonamide therapy is known to increase the possibility of kernicterus, silver sulphadiazine cream should not be used in pregnant women at term, in premature infants or in infants during the first months of life. It should not be used if hepatic and renal functions become impaired or if the condition of porphyria is suspected.

Side effects: The most common sides effects are allergic reactions including burning, itching and rashes; argyria reported following prolonged use. Transient leucopenia may occur in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy.

Precaution: Silver sulfadiazine cream should be used with caution in the presence of significant hepatic or renal impairment or if the condition of porphyria is suspected. Caution of use is required in patients known to be sensitive to systemic sulphonamides and in individuals known to have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and concomitant use with topical proteolytic enzymes. Use of silver sulfadiazine cream may delay separation of burn eschar and may alter the appearance of the burn wounds.

	Indication: Snake Venom Antiserum  is  indicated  for  bites  caused  by  Cobra,  Common  Krait,  Russell's  Viper  and  Saw-Scaled 
Viper, where the patient presents with one or more of fallowing visible clinical signs and symptoms of 
envenomation – 

1. Local envenomation-
a) Presence of bite marks with or without oozing of blood, blistering and change in color of skin.
b) Rapidly progressive or massive swelling involving more than half of the bitten limb within few hours 
of bite (without tourniquet)
c) Development of enlarged tender lymph nodes draining the bitten part within couple of hours after 
bite

2. Systemic envenomation-
a) Neurotoxic syndrome- signs of neuro-paralysis like blurring of vision, double vision, and difficulty in 
swallowing, sleepy feeling, drooping of head, slurring of speech and the voice may become indistinct 
with shallow breathing, ptosis, ataxia, respiratory paralysis and generalized flaccid paralysis.

b)  Hemotoxic  syndrome-  spontaneous  systemic  bleeding,  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain  and 
abdominal tenderness suggestive of gastro-intestinal or retro-peritoneal bleed and/or renal damage, 
coagulopathy detected by 20 min WBCT with or without external bleeding and shock.

Dose: Initial dose depends upon an estimate of the amount of envenomation as mentioned below:
1. Minimal Envenomation -Progressive local swelling but no systemic symptoms.  5 vials (50ml) is recommended to be administered.
2. Moderate  Envenomation -Swelling  beyond  the  site  of  the  bite,  mild  systemic  symptoms,  and/or hematologic and coagulation abnormalities are present. 5 to 10 vials (50 to 100ml) is recommended to be administered.
3. Severe  Envenomation -Rapidly  progressive  and  extensive  local  effects,  systemic  symptoms  and evidence  of  hemolysis  or  coagulopathy.  10  to  20  vials  (100 -200ml)  or  more  is  recommended  to  be administered.

In  children  and  small  adults  (body  weight  less  than  40kg)  upto  50%  more  doses  of  Snake    Venom Antiserum is recommended to be administered.

ADMINISTRATION:
Snake Venom Antiserum is administered intravenously either  undiluted at the rate of not more than 1ml per  minute  or  is  diluted  in  500ml  of  intravenous  fluid  (either  Sodium  Chloride  Injection  or  5%  Dextrose Injection) and  administered  as  rapidly  as  tolerated  over  1-2  hours.  While diluting the Snake Venom Antiserum, mix by gentle swirling rather than shaking to avoid foaming.
Additional  infusions  should  be  repeated  hourly  until  progressive  swelling  in  the  bitten  part  ceases  and systemic  signs  and  symptoms  disappear.  When an adequate dosage is achieved, the improvement in patient's clinical signs are often seen.


Contra-indication: There are no known contraindications for the administration of Antivenom. Person who is proven to be allergic to equine antisera.

Side effects: a) The immediate reaction (shock & anaphylaxis) usually occurs within 30 minutes. Symptoms and signs may develop before the needle is withdrawn and include urticaria, itching, fever, chills or rigor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, tachycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema.

b)  Serum sickness usually occurs 5 to 24 days after administration.  The  usual symptoms  and  signs  are  fever,  urticaria,  edema,  nausea  and  vomiting.  Occasionally neurological manifestations develop. Pain and muscle weakness are frequently present.


Precaution: Proper  precautions  are  necessary  while  dealing  with  persons  with  a  known  hypersensitivity  to 
constituents of product. Few doctors prefer to premedicate patients with Inj. Adrenaline 0.25 ml s/c to 
prevent  possibility  of  adverse  reactions.  In  haemotoxic  bites,  IM  injections  should  be  avoided  till 
correction of coagulopathy to avoid formation of haematoma and oozing of blood.

Not for local administration on bitten area.

In   patients   having   tourniquet,   it   should   be   released   slowly   only   after   start   of  Antivenom 
administration.

Mode of action: Increased risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination w/ sulfonylureas or insulin.

Oral Liquid: Adults and Children >12 years: Take 10-20 mL (two to four 5 mL spoonfuls). Children 6-12 years: Take 5-10 mL (one to two 5 mL spoonfuls). Administered after meals and at bedtime.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity

Side effects: Gastrointestinal

Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported the most frequently. These have included constipation (secondary to aluminum hydroxide therapy) and diarrhea (secondary to magnesium carbonate therapy). 

Patients with renal failure may be at risk of aluminum toxicity because of ingestion of aluminum hydroxide and because of exposure to aluminum-containing water used for dialysate solutions. Adverse effects of aluminum accumulation in these patients has led to monitoring of water source aluminum content by dialysis units and periodic measurements of serum aluminum in patients undergoing chronic dialysis.

Concurrent administration of aluminum hydroxide with citrate containing products has been associated with unusually high serum concentrations of aluminum and, especially in cases of renal failure, severe toxicity. Citrate may increase aluminum solubility and absorption.

During long-term use, aluminum has been shown to deposit in bone, joint, and brain.

Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia may include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, EKG changes, respiratory depression, loss of deep tendon reflex, dilated pupils, altered mental status, and coma.

Metabolic

Metabolic side effects have included hypophosphatemia with the use of aluminum hydroxide. In patients on long-term aluminum hydroxide therapy, especially in association with poor diets, hypophosphatemia may result in muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and encephalopathy.

Osteomalacia due to aluminum deposition in bone is generally only seen in patients with chronic renal failure. Bone formation slows in response to aluminum bone deposits. Aluminum may also deposit in joint tissue, resulting in arthropathy and hydrarthrosis.

Musculoskeletal side effects have included osteomalacia, due to aluminum hydroxide, which may occur by two different mechanisms. Osteomalacia may occur due to hypophosphatemia or due to aluminum accumulation in bone. Osteomalacia due to hypophosphatemia is often accompanied by malaise, bone pain, muscular weakness, and bone fractures. Osteomalacia due to aluminum deposition may present in a similar fashion and occurs predominately in patients with chronic renal failure. Aluminum deposits typically can be observed on bone biopsy.
Nervous system

Encephalopathy associated with aluminum accumulation is characterized by speech disorders, dysarthria, dyspraxia, dysphasia, tremor, myoclonus, seizures, coma, and ultimately death. EEG of patients with aluminum encephalopathy may show paroxysmal slowing and diffuse rhythmical bursts of delta activity.
Renal

Renal side effects have rarely included formation of renal calculi, most probably due to hypercalciuria, with the use of aluminum hydroxide.


Precaution: Magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide and alginic acid have not been formally assigned to a pregnancy category by the FDA. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy.  Magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide and alginic acid should only be given in pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.

	Indication: For irrigation during various surgical procedures of the eyes, ears, nose and/or throat.

Dose: This ocular irrigating solution should be used according to standard format for each surgical procedure. Note: Use an administration set with an air inlet in the plastic spike since the bottle does not contain a separate airway tube. Follow directions of the particular administration set to be used.

Grasp plastic ring on top of bottle and pull down along scored area. Then pull radially around the cap and remove. Remove the spike port protective cover by lifting up on the finger grip tab. Insert spike aseptically into the bottle through the center target area of the recessed membrane. Allow the fluid to flow and remove air from the tubing before irrigation begins.

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the products.

Side effects: When the corneal endothelium is abnormal, irrigation or any other trauma may result in bullous keratopathy. Postoperative inflammatory reactions as well as incidents of corneal edema and corneal decompensation have been reported. Their relationship to the use of BSS has not been established.

Precaution: Not for injection or IV infusion.This solution contains no preservative and should not be used for more than one patient. Use only if vacuum is present, and if container and seal are undamaged and solution is clear.
The addition of any medication to BSS may result in damage to intraocular tissue. There have been rare reports of corneal clouding or edema following ocular surgery in which BSS was used as an irrigating solution. As in all surgical procedures appropriate measures should be taken to minimize trauma to the cornea and other ocular tissues.

Child: As a 2% ointment/cream/gel: Apply onto affected area 3-4 times daily until there is improvement. If gauze dressing is used, then frequency of application may be reduced to 1-2 times daily.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to fusidic acid.

Side effects: Fucidin given orally may cause gastrointestinal disturbances (dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting) which can normally be avoided by giving Fucidin with meals. Reversible increase of transaminases is reported at daily dosages of 1.5-3 g of Fucidin tablets. Reversible jaundice has been reported in some patients after administration of systemic Fucidin, most frequently in patients receiving IV Fucidin in high dosage and especially in serious Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. In some cases, instituting oral therapy may be beneficial. If the jaundice persists, Fucidin should be withdrawn, after which the serum bilirubin will return to normal. Allergic reactions are reported in very few cases.

Precaution: As fusidic acid is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through the bile, periodic liver function tests should be carried out in patients with liver dysfunction, abnormalities in the biliary pathway, when fusidic acid is given in high doses for prolonged periods, or when it is given in combination with other antibiotics which have similar excretion pathways eg, lincomycin and rifampicin. In vitro, fusidic acid displaces bilirubin from its albumin-binding site. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain and kernicterus has not been observed in neonates receiving systemic Fucidin. However, this observation should be borne in mind when fusidic acid is given to preterm, jaundiced, acidotic or seriously ill neonates.
Use in pregnancy & lactation: Animal studies and many years of clinical experience have suggested that Fucidin is devoid of teratogenic effects. Fusidic acid passes the placenta and should be avoided during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy due to the theoretical risk of kernicterus.
Concentrations of fusidic acid found in breast milk are negligible and its use is not contraindicated in nursing mothers.

Hepatic impairment: Contraindicated.

Contra-indication: Sodium Valproate is contraindicated to patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug and liver dysfunction. Care should be exercised when prescribing Sodium Valproate in women of child bearing age.

Side effects: The most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Sodium Valproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children below 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone to suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Sodium Valproate.

Precaution: Liver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue potential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment, pregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus. Sodium Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketone metabolite, which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. Sudden withdrawal of therapy should be avoided.

Child: Loading dose: 2500-4000 units/kg over 30 min, followed by infusion of 500-1000 units/kg/hr, continued until reperfusion occurs, up to 3 days. Initial dose may be estimated by streptokinase resistance test. Monitor treatment by maintaining thrombin clotting time at 2-4 times normal values.



Contra-indication: Severe hypertension, recent stroke, cerebral neoplasm, recent history of peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, coagulation defects also due to liver or kidney disease, recent surgery, childbirth. Hypersensitivity, increased risk of cerebral bleeding, trauma. Pregnancy. Active internal bleeding, bleeding GI lesions. Arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm; recent (within 10 days) facial or head trauma, intracranial or intraspinal surgery, More than 5 days and less than 12 months since previous Streptokinase therapy.

Side effects: Headache and back pain, muscle pain (including myalgia), chills and/or fever as well as asthenia/malaise. Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleedings (including aggravation of menstrual bleeding), epistaxis. Development of antistreptokinase antibodies. Hypotension, heart rate and rhythm disorders, angina pectoris. Recurrent ischaemia, heart failure, reinfarction, cardiogenic shock, pericarditis, pulmonary oedema. Nausea, diarrhoea, epigastric pain and vomiting. Arrhythmia, bruising, rash, pruritus, acute renal failure due to embolism and haemorrhage. Cerebral, peripheral and pulmonary embolism. Allergic reactions, liver enzyme abnormalities, hypotension. Potentially Fatal: Haemorrhage; anaphylactic shock.

Precaution: Mitral stenosis associated with AF. Streptokinase treatment within last 12 mth, use after prolonged or traumatic CPR; diabetic retinopathy. Elderly. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, due to antistreptokinase antibodies, retreatment with Streptokinase or Streptokinase-containing products may not be effective if administered between five days and twelve months of prior Streptokinase administration or Streptococcal infections, such as Streptococcal pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis secondary to a Streptococcal infection. In principle, no thrombolytic treatment should be commenced before the 10th postoperative day. However, in cases of pulmonary embolism, the indication for earlier treatment may be very strong and after careful consideration of all the risks, Streptokinase may be given before the tenth postoperative day. The danger of bleeding from the operative area must, of course, be taken into account. The danger of haemorrhage is increased by simultaneous or previous treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., Heparin) or substances which inhibit platelet formation or function. If the patient is under active heparinisation, it should be neutralised by the administration of protamine sulphate before the start of thrombolytic therapy.  Repeated Administration After administration of Streptokinase, the titre of antistreptokinase antibodies begins to rise after approximately one week, reaching a peak at 2 to 3 weeks and remains elevated for 8 to 12 months. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, Streptokinase may not be effective if given during this period.

Mode of action: Antagonistic effects with antifibrinolytic agents e.g. aminocaproic acid.
Potentially Fatal: Anticoagulants, heparin, antiplatelet agents e.g. aspirin and dipyridamole affect platelet function increasing the risk of haemorrhage.

Adult: As HCl: As modified-release preparation: 1 (one) capsule once daily is recommended as the dose for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH. It should be administered approximately one-half hour following the same meal each day. 

For those patients who fail to respond to the 0.4 mg dose after two to four weeks of dosing, the dose of capsules can be increased to 0.8 mg once daily. 

If capsules administration is discontinued or interrupted for several days at either the 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg dose, therapy should be started again with the 0.4 mg once daily dose.

Renal impairment:
CrCl (ml/min)	
>10	No dose adjustment needed.
<10	        Not studied.

Hepatic impairment: Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A and B): No dose adjustment needed. Severe hepatic impairment: Avoid.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to sulfonamide, severe hepatic impairment, lactation.

Side effects: The following adverse reactions have been reported during the use of Tamsulosin: dizziness, abnormal ejaculation, and less frequently (1-2%) headache, asthenia, postural hypotension, palpitations and rhinitis. Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation can occasionally occur. Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, and urticaria can occur occasionally. As with other alpha-blockers, drowsiness, blurred vision, dry mouth or oedema can occur. Syncope has been reported rarely, and there have been very rare reports of angioedema and priapism.

Precaution: Hypersensitivity to Tamsulosin Hydrochloride. A history of orthostatic hypotension; severe hepatic insufficiency. As with other alpha1 blockers, a reduction in blood pressure can occur in individual cases during treatment with Tamsulosin, as a result of which, rarely, syncope can occur. At the first signs of orthostatic hypotension (dizziness, weakness) the patient should sit or lie down until the symptoms have disappeared. And they should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result (like driving, operating machinery or performing hazardous tasks). Before therapy with Tamsulosin is initiated the patient should be examined in order to exclude the presence of other conditions which can cause the same symptoms as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Digital rectal examination and when necessary determination of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) should be performed before treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. The treatment of severely renal impaired patients (creatinine clearance is less than10ml/min) should be approached with caution as these patients have not been studied. Caution should be exercised in porphyria or allergic reaction to this or any other medicine.

Mode of action: Increased plasma concentration w/ strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole). Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin), strong (e.g. paroxetine) or moderate (e.g. terbinafine) CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase exposure of tamsulosin. Increased plasma concentration w/ cimetidine. Additive effect w/ other ?-adrenergic blocking agents. Concomitant use w/ PDE5 inhibitors may lead to symptomatic hypotension. Decreased plasma concentration w/ furosemide.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Increased plasma concentration w/ strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole).

Precaution: Opioid REMS

    FDA now requires risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for extended-release (ER) and long-acting (LA) opioid analgesics
    REMS strongly encourages prescribers to complete REMS-compliant education program and to counsel patients regarding safe use, risks, storage, and disposal of ER/LA opioids

Limitations of use

    ER/LA opioids are intended only for management of moderate-to-severe pain when continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for extended period
    ER/LA opioids are not intended for PRN use, acute pain, or postoperative pain (unless patient is already receiving long-term opioid therapy before surgery or postoperative pain is expected to persist for extended period

Abuse potential

    Druig is controlled substance with abuse potential; assess patient’s risk for opioid abuse or addiction (including alcohol) before prescribing
    Assess mental illness (eg, major depressive disorder)
    Routinely monitor for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction during treatment

Life-threatening respiratory depression

    Respiratory depression, including fatal cases, may occur even when drug is used at recommended doses without misuse or abuse; proper dosing titration is essential and should be prescribed by healthcare providers knowledgeable in use of opioids and pain relief
    Follow administration instructions for ER/LA opioids regarding swallowing whole (ie, do not chew, crush, or dissolve tablet) to avoid too-rapid release and absorption of potentially fatal dose

Accidental exposure

    Accidental ingestion, especially in children, can result in fatal overdose of opioid analgesic

Alcohol interaction

    Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use alcohol-containing drug products while taking morphine
    Coingestion of alcohol with opioid analgesics may increase plasma opioid levels and potentially result in fatal overdose

	Indication: Acne, Stable plaque psoriasis, Photo aging

Dose: For psoriasis: Apply once daily in the evening usually for up to twelve weeks. Use and dose must be determined by the doctor of children upto 12 years of age.
For acne: Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer of Tazarotene cream once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affeted area. 

Contra-indication: It is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any ingredients of Tazarotene cream.

Side effects: Generally Tazarotene cream is well-tolerated .The most frequent adverse events related to treatment with Tazarotene are skin-related as for example pruritus, erythema, burning, irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema.

Precaution: Tazarotene cream should be applied only to the affected areas. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, and mouth. If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.
Retinoid should not be used on eczematous skin, as they may cause severe irritation.
Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of Tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity.

	CSL Behring GmbH, Germany	Human Anti-tetanus Immuno Globulin Injection 250 IU  1200
	Indication: Passive immunisation against Tetanus

Dose: Adults and children 7 years and older: 250 units(1 ml) should be given by deep intramuscular injection . 
At the same time, but in a different extremity and with a separate syringe, active immunization with adsorved tetanus vaccine should be administered. 

Children less than 7 years old: In small children the routine prophylactic dose  may be calculated by the body weight (4.0 units/kg). 

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity homologous Ig-containing medicinal products particularly in patients w/ IgA deficiency & concurrent presence of Ab to IgA.

Side effects: Slight soreness at the site of injection and slight temperature elevation may be noted at times. Sensitization to repeated injections of human immunoglobulin is extremely rare.

In the course of routine injections of large numbers of persons with immunoglobulin there have been a few isolated occurrences of angioneurotic edema, nephrotic syndrome, and anaphylactic shock after injection.

Precaution: Intravenous injection of immunoglobulin intended for intramuscular use can, on occasion, cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure, and a picture not unlike anaphylaxis. Injections should only be made intramuscularly and care should be taken to draw back on the plunger of the syringe before injection in order to be certain that the needle is not in a blood vessel. Intramuscular injections are preferably administered in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal region should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.

Chemoprophylaxis against tetanus is neither practical nor useful in managing wounds. Wound cleaning, debridement when indicated, and proper immunization are important. The need for tetanus toxoid (active immunization), with or without TIG (passive immunization), depends on both the condition of the wound and the patient’s vaccination history. Rarely has tetanus occurred among persons with documentation of having received a primary series of toxoid injections.

Mode of action: May reduce the efficacy of live vaccines.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: May reduce the efficacy of live vaccines.Incepta	Vaxitet-IG Injection 3000 IU/ml 1's pack 408
	Fisons, UK	Tetabulin Injection  10's amps pack 7500
	Indication: Immediate protection against Tetanus

Dose: Prophylaxis of tetanus: Tetanus Antitoxin (equine) should not be used in the routine treatment of traumatic wounds. It is given prophylactically to persons at the risk of tetanus infection by infected wounds or severe wounds. 

For prophylaxis after injury, non-immune or partially immune persons may be given 3,000 to 5,000 units of tetanus antitoxin subcutaneously or intramuscularly. If 24 hours have passed since the wound occurred, the dose is 3,000 IU. 

In crush wounds or wounds contaminated with soil or other foreign bodies, the dose is 10,000 to 20,000 IU. For persons below 30 kg the dosage is 1,500 IU. 

Active immunization with Adsorbed Tetanus vaccine should be given simultaneously with the use of this preparation or a booster injection of Adsorbed Tetanus vaccine should be given if the patient has previously been immunized. 

Treatment: Therapy should be given as soon as possible after the appearance of symptoms of the disease. Therapeutic dose not less than 3000 IU. Depending on the severity, the dose may vary from 50,000 to 100,000 IU of tetanus antitoxin for hospitalized patients given partially by intravenous route and the rest of the dose intramuscularly.



Contra-indication: Should be used with great caution if patient is subject to allergic disease such as asthma or infantile eczema, or was allergic to any previous antiserum injection.


Side effects: Reactions are liable to occur after the injection of any serum of animal origin. Anaphylaxis may occur in rare cases, with hypotension, dyspnoea, urticaria, and shock. Anaphylactic reactions should be treated with adrenalin, possibly in association with antihistamine and corticosteroid therapy. Serum sickness may occur 7 to 10 days after injection of serum of animal origin; symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, bronchospasm, and urticaria; nephritis, myocarditis, neuritis, polyarthritis, and uveitis have been reported as rare complications of serum sickness.


Precaution: If there is no history of previous serum injection or allergic reaction, the dose of serum may be given intramuscularly. If the patient is subject to allergic diseases, a trial dose of 0,2 mL (diluted 1:10 if preferred) of the serum should be given subcutaneously; if no general reaction develops during an interval of 30 minutes, the main dose may be given intramuscularly. The patient must be kept under observation for at least 30 minutes after the injection and adrenaline kept in readiness for emergency use. In all urgent cases, the intravenous route is indicated, but should never be used unless a preliminary intramuscular injection, given at least 30 minutes beforehand, has been tolerated. For intravenous use, the serum should be at room temperature, the injection should be given very slowly, and the patient should be recumbent during the injection, and for at least an hour afterwards.


Mode of action: Decreased immunologic response with concurrent immunosuppressants. Neutralisation of tetanus immune globulin and tetanus toxoid adsorbed if not given at different sites using different syringes.

	Indication: Active immunisation against tetanus, Postexposure prophylaxis of tetanus

Dose: Primary immunization for persons 7 years of age and older: A series of three doses of 0.5 ml each, of adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be given intramuscularly; First dose: At appropriate date, Second dose: 4 to 8 weeks after the first dose, Third dose: 6 to 12 months after the second dose.

Children older than 7 years who did not complete primary immunization series (e.g., previously received only two doses of DTaP or DTP) need to receive only one dose of tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine to complete the primary series of tetanus.
Interruption of the recommended schedule with a delay between doses does not interfere with the final immunity achieved with adsorbed tetanus vaccine. There is no need to start the series over again, regardless of the time elapsed between doses.

Routine booster injections: To maintain adequate protection, a booster dose of 0.5 ml of adsorbed tetanus vaccine every 10 years thereafter is recommended.

Vaccination of injured persons:
Clean and minor wound: 
•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, no need of additional vaccine.
•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.

All other dirty wounds (contaminated with feces, soil, and saliva): 
•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.
•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml along with tetanus immunoglobulin required.

If a person has no previous vaccination or uncertain, the primary series of 3 doses of 0.5ml adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be given along with tetanus immunoglobulin with 1st dose.
Protection of neonatal tetanus
For prevention of neonatal tetanus, adsorbed tetanus vaccine is recommended for immunization of women of childbearing age.
 
For pregnant woman who have not had previous immunization, 2 doses of tetanus toxoid at four weeks interval preferably during the last two trimester or at least 2 weeks before delivery should be given during pregnancy so that protective antibody would be transferred to the infant in order to prevent neonatal tetanus. e.g. 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 6th month of pregnancy and 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 7th month of pregnancy.

Pregnant woman who have completed the course of tetanus, next 10 years no need of additional dose during pregnancy. Thereafter a single booster dose would be sufficient to extend immunity.


Contra-indication: It is a contraindication to use this or any other related vaccine after a serious adverse event temporally associated with a previous dose including an anaphylactic reaction. A history of systemic allergic or neurologic reactions following a previous dose of Tetanus Toxoid is an absolute contraindication for further use. 

If a contraindication to using tetanus toxoid -containing preparations exists in a person who has not completed a primary immunizing course of tetanus toxoid and other than a clean, minor wound is sustained; only passive immunization should be given using TIG (Human). 

Elective immunization should be deferred during the course of any febrile illness or acute infection. A minor afebrile illness such as a mild upper respiratory infection should not preclude immunization. Elective immunization procedures should be deferred during an outbreak of poliomyelitis. 


Side effects: Mild inj site reactions eg transient swelling, rash, fever, malaise, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, pruritus, dizziness.Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions. 

Precaution: Do not administer IV. Use subcutaneous route in bleeding disorders. Withhold vaccination in moderate or severe febrile illness. Pregnancy, lactation, history of Guillian-Barre syndrome.

	Indication: Prevention of thrombotic events [cardiovascular death (CV), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke] in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) [unstable angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)]; including patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Dose: Initiate treatment with 180 mg (two 90 mg tablets) oral loading dose. Continue treatment with 90 mg twice daily. 

 After the initial loading dose of Aspirin (usually 325 mg), use Ticagrelor with a daily maintenance dose of Aspirin should be of 75-100 mg. 

ACS patients who have received a loading dose of Clopidogrel, may be started on Ticagrelor. Ticagrelor can be administered with or without food. A patient who misses a dose of Ticagrelor should take one 90 mg tablet (next dose) at its scheduled time.

Contra-indication: History of Intracranial Hemorrhage: Ticagrelor is not recommended in patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) due to a high risk of recurrent ICH in this population.

Active Bleeding: Patients with active pathological bleeding eg, peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.

Severe Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment because of a probable increase in exposure, and it has not been studied in these patients. Severe hepatic impairment increases the risk of bleeding because of reduced synthesis of coagulation proteins. 

Hypersensitivity (eg, angioedema) to ticagrelor or to any of the components.

Side effects: Bleeding, Dyspnea, Other side effects (Headache, back pain, nausea, dizziness, cough, hypotension, fatigue, Atrial fibrillation). 

Precaution: General Risk of Bleeding: Drugs that inhibit platelet function including Ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding. 
Concomitant Aspirin Maintenance Dose: Use of Ticagrelor with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg decreased the effectiveness of Ticagrelor. Therefore, after the initial loading dose of aspirin (usually 325 mg), use Ticagrelor with a maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. 

Moderate Hepatic Impairment: Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 

Discontinuation of Ticagrelor: Discontinuation of Ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and death. 

Mode of action: Aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid &/or recombinant clotting factor VIIa may augment haemostatis. NSAIDs, oral anticoagulants &/or fibrinolytics, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, atazanavir, rifampin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarb, simvastatin >40 mg, digoxin.

Continue to monitor all patients for active tuberculosis during therapy

Mode of action: Interactions with Other Medications and Other Forms of Interaction: Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance.

Tocilizumab has not been studied in combination with other biological DMARDs.

The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, eg, IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, eg, tocilizumab is introduced.

In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tocilizumab normalizes expression of these enzymes.

The effect of tocilizumab on CYP enzymes (except CYP2C19 and CYP2D6) is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, and/or where the dose is individually adjusted.

In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar or slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects.

When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medications, which are individually dose-adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2, or 2C9 (eg, atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses of these products may need to be adjusted to maintain their therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination t½, the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.

	Indication: Aid in ophthalmic surgery by staining the anterior capsule of the lens.

Dose: Trypan blue is packaged in a 2.25 mL syringe to which a blunt cannula has to be attached.

After opening the eye, an air bubble is injected into the anterior chamber of the eye in order to minimize dilution of  (trypan blue) by the aqueous.  (trypan blue) is carefully applied onto the anterior lens capsule using a blunt cannula. Sufficient staining is achieved as soon as the dye has contacted the capsule. The anterior chamber is then irrigated with balanced salt solution to remove all excess dye. An anterior capsulotomy can then be performed.

Contra-indication:  (Trypan blue) is contraindicated when a non-hydrated (dry state), hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) is planned to be inserted into the eye because the dye may be absorbed by the IOL and stain the IOL.

Side effects: Adverse reactions reported following use of  (trypan blue) include discoloration of high water content hydrogen intraocular lenses and inadvertent staining of the posterior lens capsule and vitreous face.

Precaution: General: It is recommended that after injection all excess (trypan blue) be immediately removed from the eye by thorough irrigation of the anterior chamber.

Precaution: Existing Pregnancy
Not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. Pregnancy should be excluded before prescribing Ulipristal Acetate.

Ectopic Pregnancy
A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to use of this emergency contraceptive method. 

Repeated Use
Ulipristal Acetate is for occasional use as an emergency contraceptive. It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of Ulipristal Acetate within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.

Fertility Following Use
A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with Ulipristal Acetate for emergency contraception; therefore, routine contraception should be continued or initiated as soon as possible following use of Ulipristal Acetate to ensure ongoing prevention of pregnancy. 
Effect on Menstrual Cycle

After Ulipristal Acetate intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. 

Contraception
Concomitant use of progestagen only pills, a progestagen releasing intrauterine device or combined oral contraceptive pills is not recommended (see Interactions).

Pediatric:
CMV Prevention in Kidney & Heart Transplant

<4 months: Safety and efficacy not established

4 months -16 years: Daily dose = 7 mg x BSA x CrCl; not to exceed 900 mg/day 

Begin within 10 days of transplant until 100 days post-transplant

Calculate BSA by Mosteller equation

    BSA (sq.meter) = height (cm) X weight (kg) divided by 3600 

Calculate CrCl by Schwartz equation

    CrCl (mL/min/1.73 sq.meter) = K x height (cm) divided by serum Cr (mg/dL)
    If CrCl exceeds 150 mL/min/1.73 sq.meter, then use maximum value of 150 mL/min/1.73 sq.meter; an upper limit of 150 mL/min/1.73 sq. meter helps prevent the potential for over dosing
    If the calculated pediatric dose exceeds 900 mg, a dose of 900 mg should be given to the child
    Where K =
    0.45 for aged 4 months to <2 yr
    0.45 for boys aged 2 -12 yr and girls aged 2-16 yr

	Indication: Chickenpox

Dose: Adults
Indicated for all adults without evidence of immunity to varicella.

2 dose series: 0.5 mL SC, repeat at least 4 weeks later.

Routine vaccination

    2 dose series: 0.5 mL SC
    1st dose: 12-15 months
    2nd dose: 4-6 years; may be administered before age 4 yr, provided at least 3 months have elapsed since the first dose

Contra-indication: Do not administer  to individuals with a history of anaphylactic or severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine (including neomycin and gelatin) or to a previous dose of a varicella-containing vaccine.

Side effects: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Precaution: 5.1 Management of Allergic Reactions

Adequate treatment provisions, including epinephrine injection (1:1000), should be available for immediate use should anaphylaxis occur.

5.2 Family History of Immunodeficiency

Vaccination should be deferred in patients with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency until the patient's immune status has been evaluated and the patient has been found to be immunocompetent.

5.3 Use in HIV-Infected Individuals

The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommendations on the use of varicella vaccine in HIV-infected individuals.

5.4 Risk of Vaccine Virus Transmission

Post-marketing experience suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may occur rarely between healthy vaccinees who develop a varicella-like rash and healthy susceptible contacts. Transmission of vaccine virus from a mother who did not develop a varicella-like rash to her newborn infant has been reported.

Mode of action: Concurrent use may interfere with the immune response to certain live vaccines.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Concurrent use may interfere with the immune response to certain live vaccines.Indication: Varicella infection

Dose:  Usually, 1 dose (0.5 mL) is injected SC. Adults and adolescents: 0.5 mL dose administered SC at elected date then a 2nd 0.5 mL dose 4-8 weeks later. 

Children 12 months-12 years: 0.5 mL as a single dose to be administered SC. 

Contra-indication:  A history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine; individuals with blood dyscrasias, leukonia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasma affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems; individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy.


Side effects: Hemic and Lymphatic System: Thrombocytopenia, nervous, encephalitic, respiratory skin (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, secondary bacterial infections of skin and soft tissue including impetigo and cellulitis, herpes zoster).
Fever and rash occasionally appear in healthy children and adults 1-3 weeks after vaccination.  Anaphylactoid symptoms eg, urticaria, dyspnea, lip edema or laryngeal edema may appear rarely. A hypersensitivity reaction may rarely occur immediately after vaccination by the day following vaccination, with the appearance of rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and fever. A local reaction eg, redness, swelling and induration may rarely occur at the injection site.


Precaution: General: 
Before vaccination, the general health condition of the vaccine recipient should be evaluated clinically by taking their temperature and being examined (inspection, auscultation, etc) by a physician.
Adequate treatment provisions including epinephrine injection (1:1000), should be available for immediate use should an anaphylactoid reaction occur.
Vaccination should be deferred to at least 5 months following blood or plasma transfusion, or administration of immunoglobulin or varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG).
Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylate for 6 weeks after vaccination as rege's syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylate during varicella infection.
Vaccination should be deferred in patients with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency until the patient's own immune system has been evaluated.
Cases Requiring Careful Consideration Before Vaccination: The decision for vaccination is to be made carefully in the following categories, those having a history of seizures; those previously diagnosed with an immunodeficiency; those suffering from diseases accompanied by abnormal immune system function or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see Dosage & Administration); and those suspected of being allergic to any of the components of Okavax.
Use in pregnancy: Women of childbearing age are to be warned to practice appropriate birth control for approximately 1 month before vaccination and to avoid becoming pregnant for at least 2 months after vaccination.
Use in children: No clinical data are available on the safety or efficacy of Okavax vaccine in children <1 year, therefore, administration in infants <12 months is not recommended.
Use in the elderly: Since the elderly frequently have decreased physiologic function, it is advisable to carefully evaluate the health condition before vaccination.

Mode of action: Concurrent use may interfere with the immune response to certain live vaccines.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Concurrent use may interfere with the immune response to certain live vaccines.ACI	Vecuron Injection 4mg/ml 5's pack 410

For angina the usual dose is 80 mg to 120 mg three times a day.

For arrythmias in digitalized patients, Verapamil should be given 240 mg to 360 mg in divided doses, depending on the severity of the condition. Divided doses up to 180 mg/day may occasionally be needed.

Intravenous: Adults: 5mg slowly intravenously, in tachycardias and hypertensive crises, if necessary repeat after 5 to 10 minutes. 

Drip infusion to maintain the therapeutic effect: 5-10 mg/hour in physiological saline, glucose, laevulose or similar solutions, on average up to a total dose of 100mg/day.   

Children: Newborn 0.75-1mg (= 0.3-0.4ml) 
Infants 0.75-2mg (= 0.3-0.8ml) 
Children age 1-5 years: 2-3mg (= 0.8-1.2ml) 
age 6-14 years: 2.5-5mg (= 1-2ml) of Verapamil, given intravenously, depending on age and action. 

The injection should be made slowly under electrocardiographic control and only until onset of the effect. 

Intravenous infusion in hypertensive crises: initially 0.05-0.1mg/kg/hour; if the effect proves to be insufficient, the dose is increased at 30-60 minute intervals until twice the dose or more is reached. Average total dose up to 1.5mg/kg/day.

Contra-indication: Severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension or cardiogenic shockSick sinus syndrome (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker)Second or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker)Patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and an accessory by pass tract(eg. Wolff-Parkinson-White, Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome)Patients with known hypersensitivity to verapamil hydrochlorideVerapamil injection should not be administered intravenously to patients on beta-blockers (except in an intensive care setting) and known hypersensitivity to Verapamil hydrochloride.

Side effects: Verapamil is generally well tolerated. The following reaction to orally administered Verapamil appeared clearly drug related or occurred at rates greater than 1% in clinical trials with approximately 5000 patients.Digestive system: Constipation, nausea;Cardiovascular system: Hypotension, edema, CHF, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, AV block;Respiratory system: Upper respiratory tract infections;Nervous system: Dizziness, headache, fatigue;Skin: Rash, flashing;Hepatic: Elevated liver enzyme.

Precaution: Care should be taken in 1st degree AV block, bradycardia <50 beats/minutes, hypotension <90 mm Hg systolic pressure, atrial fibrillation/flutter and simultaneous pre-excitation syndrome e.g. WPW syndrome, heart failure (previous compensation with cardiac glycosides/diuretics required).Verapamil may impair ability to drive or operate machinery, particularly in the initial stages of treatment and with concomitant consumption of alcohol. 

Verapamil markedly slows down the elimination of alcohol and prolongs the duration of the effects of alcohol.Verapamil should be given as a slow intravenous injection over at least 2 minutes under continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring. Intravenous injection should only be given by the physician.In atrial fibrillation and simultaneous WPW syndrome there is a risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation

	Indication: Daily multivitamin maintenance dosage for adults and children aged 11 years and above receiving parenteral nutrition. It is also indicated in other situations include surgery, extensive burns, fractures and other trauma, severe infectious diseases and comatose states, which may provoke a "stress" situation with profound alterations in the body's metabolic demands and consequent tissue depletion of nutrients.

Dose: Adults and children aged 11 years and above: 1 vial/day 

Administration procedure: The single dose vial is reconstituted by adding 5ml of sterile Water for injection or other intravenous fluids like 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection or 5% Glucose injection. 5 ml of diluent should be added by means of sterile syringe into the vial and gently mixed to dissolve the lyophilized powder. The entire volume of the resultant solution should then be administered by slow Intravenous injection (at least over 10 minutes) or further diluted for intravenous infusion. To minimize vitamin losses in parenteral nutrition admixtures, add the vitamins immediately prior to administration and complete administration within 24 hours.

Contra-indication: This is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing hypervitaminosis or known hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients. This product should not be injected to patients with pre-existing intolerance to thiamine. 

Similarly, this product should not be administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. This preparation should not be administered to those suffering from hyperparathyroidism due to hypercalcaemic complications.

Side effects: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported following large intravenous doses of Thiamine. Urticaria and rash have also been associated with this preparation. There have been very rare reports of anaphylactic reactions following IV injection/infusion with this preparation over 1-4 minutes.

Precaution: Anaphylactic reactions may occur in allergic subjects who are susceptible to Thiamine (Vitamin B1) and nicotinamide components of this product. Mild allergic reactions such as sneezing or mild asthma are warning signs that further injection/infusion may give rise to anaphylactic shock. Due to glychocolic acid content, repeated and prolonged administration in patients with jaundice of hepatic origin or severe biochemical evidence of cholestatis requires careful monitoring of liver function. Also in the case of impaired kidney function, fat-soluble vitamin levels should be carefully monitored.

	Indication: Vitamin B deficiency. Glossitis, stomatitis, cheilosis, beriberi polyneuritis.

Dose: Tablet/Capsule : 1-2, 3 times daily or as directed by the physician. Syrup : 2-3 teaspoonful daily. Injection : 2 ml daily IV or IM. 

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to any of its components.

	Indication: Supplement for intravenous nutrition in order to meet the daily requirements of the water-soluble vitamins in infants, adults and children. 

Dose: Adults and children age 11 years and above: One vial (10 ml) daily. 1-2 Capsule daily.
Children below 11 years of age: Children weighing less than 10 kg should be given 1 ml of the dissolved mixture per kg body weight /day.
Children weighing 10 kg or more should be given 10 ml (one vial) of the dissolved mixture /day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the preparation.

Side effects: The unwanted effects of nutrient solutions are a rise in the body temperature, shivering, chills and nausea and vomiting. Adverse reactions that may be expected based on experience with other water-soluble vitamin compounds administered intravenously include: allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis; dermatological reactions including flushing, erythema and pruritus and CNS reactions including headache, dizziness and agitation etc.

Precaution: Folic acid may mask the symptoms of pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurologic manifestations remain progressive. Administering folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia. Recommended doses are insufficient to correct severe vitamin deficiency states and may be insufficient in patients with markedly increased vitamin requirements. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), routine supplementation with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is recommended to prevent deficiency states and to obviate the need to speculate on individual vitamin status. Daily vitamin requirements must be calculated to avoid over dosage and toxic effects, especially with regards to vitamins A & D and particularly in pediatric patients. 

In patients for whom total parenteral nutrition is continued for prolonged periods (months or years), periodic monitoring of blood vitamin levels should be considered. To prevent excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins and for reasons of safety, daily dosage should be administered over a number of hours. 

Mode of action: Decreased GI tract absorption with neomycin, aminosalicylic acid, H2-blockers and colchicine. Reduced serum concentrations with oral contraceptives. Reduced effects in anaemia with parenteral chloramphenicol.

Interaction:Aristopharma	Arovital Injection  1's vial 200
	Indication: It is intended as a supplement for intravenous nutrition in order to meet the daily requirements of the water-soluble vitamins in infants, children and adults. 

Dose: Adults: For adult patients and children weighing 10 kg or more, the recommended daily doses are the content of 1 vial (10 ml).

Children: Children weighing less than 10 kg should be given 1/10 of the content of one vial i.e. 1 ml per kg body weight per day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the preparation. 

Side effects: The unwanted effects of nutrient solutions are a rise in the body temperature, shivering, chills and nausea and vomiting. Other rare unwanted effects include: allergic reactions; breathing difficulties (rapid breathing, shortness of breath); effects on blood pressure, abdominal pain, tiredness, headaches, flushing, slight pressure over the eyes and dizziness. 

Precaution: Administering folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), routine supplementation with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is recommended to prevent deficiency states and to obviate the need to speculate on individual vitamin status. Daily vitamin requirements must be calculated to avoid over dosage and toxic effects, especially with regards to vitamins A & D and particularly in pediatric patients. In patients for whom total parenteral nutrition is continued for prolonged periods (months or years), periodic monitoring of blood vitamin levels should be considered. To prevent excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins and for reasons of safety, daily dosage should be administered over a number of hours.

Dose: Tablet: 1-2 tablets three times daily.

Injection: In severe cases, 1 ampoule daily until the acute symptoms subsides. For milder cases, & follow up therapy 2 or 3 should be injected weekly.

Contra-indication: Should not be used in the patients on Levodopa therapy and hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients.

Side effects: Generally well tolerated. However, a few allergic reactions may be seen.

Precaution: Cyanocobalamin should not be given before a diagnosis has been fully established because of the possibility of masking symptoms of subacute degeneration of the spinal cord.

Interaction:Indication: Biotin deficiency,  tissue maintenance, healthy skin, nails & hairs, weight loss,  Hairfall, premature greying, neuropathy, relief from heart problems, alopecia, Parkinson’s disease, Rett syndrome and vaginal candidiasis.

Dose: An adequate amount of biotin is about 30 to 100 mcg daily. The biotin,  used for nutritional supplement and food labeling purposes, is 300 micrograms/day. 

Doses of up to 2,500 mcg have been used safely to treat hair and nail problems. Higher intakes have been recommended for reducing blood sugar levels in diabetics (5-15 mg/d). Vitamin B 7 works best when combined with B-vitamins. 

Contra-indication: 

Side effects: No side effects have been reported for biotin in amounts up to 10 milligrams a day. Like other water soluble B-vitamins, excess biotin is excreted in the urine. Even when taken in high doses (2,500 mcg to treat hair and nail problems), there are no known side effects. In people without disorders of biotin metabolism, doses of up to 5 mg/day for two years were not associated with adverse effects.

Precaution: Biotin deficiency can be induced in humans by feeding them raw egg whites, which contain a protein that binds biotin and prevents its absorption. Long-term antibiotic use can interfere with biotin production in the intestine and increase the risk of deficiency symptoms, such as dermatitis, depression, hair loss, anemia, and nausea. Long-term use of anti-seizure medications may also lead to biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency results in fatigue, depression, nausea, muscle pains, hair loss, and anemia. Biotin is necessary for both metabolism and growth in humans, particularly with reference to production of fatty acids, antibodies, digestive enzymes, and in niacin (vitamin B3) metabolism.

	Indication: Venous thromboembolism, Stroke prevention

Dose: Oral
Treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism
Adult: Initially, 5 mg daily. Rapid anti-coagulation: Initially, 10 mg daily for 2 days. Adjust subsequent doses based on PT/INR. Usual maintenance dose: 2-10 mg daily.
Elderly: Lower initial dose.
Hepatic impairment: Severe: Avoid.



Contra-indication: 1. Actual or potential haemorrhagic conditions, eg. Peptic ulcer, or to patients with uncontrolled hypertension
2. Severe hepatic or renal disease
3. Pregnancy
4. Known hypersensitivity to warfarin
5. Bacterial endocarditis
Its use within 24 hours following surgery or labour should be undertaken with caution, if at all.

Side effects: Hemorrhage is the principal adverse effect of oral anticoagulants. Other adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersensitivity, rash, alopecia, and unexplained drop in haematocrit, "purple toes", skin necrosis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction.

Precaution: Periodic determination of prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or other suitable coagulation test is essential. Numerous factors, alone or in combination, including travel, changes in diet, environment, physical state and medication may influence response of the patient to anticoagulants. It is generally good practice to monitor the patient's response with additional PT/INR determination in the period immediately after discharge from the hospital, and whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued or taken irregularly. 

The following factors may exaggerate the effects of warfarin and necessitate a reduction in dosage; loss of weight, elderly subject, acute illness, deficient renal function, decreased dietary intake of vitamin K, administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Factors which may call for an increase in maintenance dosage include weight gain, diarrhea and vomiting, increased intake of vitamin K, fats and oils, and the administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Careful additional laboratory control is necessary if the patient is to be changed from one formulation to another. Reversal of warfarin anticoagulation by vitamin K takes several days. In emergency situations fresh frozen plasma should be given.

Mode of action: Cholestatic hepatitis may occur when taken concomitantly w/ ticlopidine. Increased risk of bleeding w/ other anticoagulants (e.g. argatroban, dabigatran, heparin), antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel), NSAIDs (e.g. celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine). Increased INR w/ CYP2C9 (e.g. amiodarone, capecitabine, cotrimoxazole), CYP1A2 (e.g. aciclovir, allopurinol, ciprofloxacin) and CYP3A4 (e.g. alprazolam, amlodipine, atorvastatin) inhibitors. Decreased INR w/ CYP2C9, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 inducers.

Potentially Fatal: Increased risk of bleeding w/ fibrinolytic drugs (e.g. streptokinase and alteplase).

	Indication: Yellow fever infection

Dose: Primary Vaccination: Adults and Children >9 months: 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine administered as a single dose.

Children <9 months: The vaccine must not be given to children <6 months. Vaccination against yellow fever is not usually recommended in children aged from 6 months up to 9 months except in specific circumstances and in accordance with available official recommendations, in which case, the dose is the same as in older children and adults.

The vaccine should be given at least 10 days before entering an endemic area since protective immunity may not be achieved until at least this time has elapsed.

Elderly: The dose is the same as for adults. However, due to a higher risk of yellow fever vaccine-associated severe and potentially fatal disease in persons from 60 years of age, the vaccine should only be given when it is considered that there is a considerable and unavoidable risk of acquiring yellow fever infection.

Re-Vaccination: Re-vaccination with 1 dose of 0.5mL is recommended every 10 years in persons considered to be at risk of exposure. International Health Regulations (IHR) require re-vaccination, using the same dose as for primary vaccination, at intervals of 10 years in order to retain a valid certificate.

For IM use, the recommended injection sites are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in the infants and toddlers (6 months up to 2 years of age) and the deltoid muscle in older children and adults.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity reaction to eggs, chicken proteins or to any component of this vaccine.
Serious hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any yellow fever vaccine.
Immunosuppression, whether congenital, idiopathic or as a result of treatment with systemic steroids (greater than the standard dose of topical or inhaled steroids), radiotherapy or cytotoxic drugs.
History of thymus dysfunction (including thymoma, thymectomy).
Symptomatic HIV infection.
Asymptomatic HIV infection when accompanied by evidence of impaired immune function (see Precautions).
Age <6 months (see Dosage & Administration and Precautions).
Current severe febrile illness.

Side effects:  Hypersensitivity. The most common adverse reactions occurring after vaccine administration were local reactions. Nervous System Disorders: Very Common: Headache.
Gastrointestinal System Disorders: Common: Nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting. Uncommon: Abdominal pain.
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Common: Myalgia. Uncommon: Arthralgia.
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Very Common: Local reactions (including pain, redness, hematoma, induration, swelling). Common: Pyrexia, asthenia.

Precaution: As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reaction following administration of the vaccine.
Stamaril should be administered only to persons who are or will be at risk of infection with yellow fever virus or who must be vaccinated to comply with IHR.
Immunosuppressed Persons:It must not be administered to immunosuppressed persons.
Children Born to HIV Positive Mothers: Children aged at least 6 months may be vaccinated if it is confirmed that they are not infected with HIV.
HIV-infected children aged at least 6 months who are potentially in need of protection against yellow fever should be referred to a specialist paediatric team for advice on whether or not to vaccinate.
 This vaccine must not be administered to children before the age of 6 months.

Sixty Years and Older: Some serious and potentially fatal adverse reactions (including systemic and neurological reactions persisting >48 hrs, YEL-AVD and YEL-AND) appear to occur at higher frequencies after the age of 60 years. Therefore, the vaccine should only be given to those who have a considerable risk of acquiring yellow fever.
Because IM injection can cause injection site haematoma, Stamaril should not be given by the IM route to persons with any bleeding disorder, eg, haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or to persons on anticoagulant therapy. The subcutaneous route of administration should be used instead.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this vaccine.

Mode of action: Zuclopenthixol may enhance the sedative effects of alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. Zuclopenthixol reduces the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine. Concomitant use of metoclopramide and piperazine with zuclopenthixol increases the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Increased risk of severe neurotoxicity with lithium and sibutramine. Increased anticholinergic side effects with drugs with anticholinergic properties.

Potentially Fatal: Antagonises effect of apomorphine, levodopa and other dopamine agonists. Increased risk of blood dyscrasias with clozapine. Increased risk of arrhythmias with dugs that prolong QT interval e.g. class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, erythromycin or cause electrolyte disturbances e.g. thiazide diuretics.
