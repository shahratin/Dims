Prophylaxis & therapy of protein deficiency resulting from increased protein losses &/or increased protein requirements.\n\nDose: Adults:\n\nThe nitrogen requirement for maintenance of body protein mass depends on the patient's condition (nutritional state and degree of metabolic stress).\nNo or minor metabolic stress and normal nutritional state: 0.10-0.15 g nitrogen/kg/day,\nModerate metabolic stress with or without malnutrition: 0.15-0.20 g nitrogen/kg/day,\nSevere catabolism as in burns, sepsis and trauma: up to 0.20-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day.\n\nThe dosage range 0.10-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day corresponds to 15-35 ml amino acid IV/kg/day.\nIn obese patients, the dose should be based on the estimated ideal weight. Depending upon patients requirements, 1000-2000 ml amino acid may be infused intravenously per 24 hours. It should be infused slowly, at rates 1.4-2.8 ml (30-60 drops) per minute.\n\nInfants and Children:\nIn children and infants, the rate of infusion is 28-35 ml/kg body wt/day is recommended, with a stepwise increment in the rate of administration during the first week of treatment.\n\nContra-indication: Contraindicated in patients with inborn errors of amino acids metabolism. Moreover, amino acid should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.\n\nSide effects: It is usually well tolerated. Yet nausea, vomiting, flushing and sweating have been observed during infusion of amino acid IV at rates exceeding the recommended maximal rate. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Like all hypertonic infusion solution, thrombophlebitis may occur when peripheral veins are used. The incidence may be reduced by the simultaneous infusion of 10% fat emulsion. If it is infused to severely ill patients, premature infants, hyperphenylalaninemia may occur.\n\nPrecaution: Hyperphenylalaninemia has been noted in severely ill, premature infants. In these patients, monitoring of the phenylalanine levels is recommended and the infusion rate adjusted as needed.\nDo not use if the solution is turbid or contains particles. Discard any unused portion.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: 
Amino Acids 7 % + Glucose & Electrolytes 10 %	\n\n\tAcme Ltd.\tAminomix IV Infusion   \n\tBeximco\tNutrimin-D IV Infusion   500 ml bot 410\n\tGeneral\tPowersol Plus IV Infusion   500ml 400\n\tOpsonin Pharma\tClinosol Gold IV Infusion    500 ml bot 401.51\n\tOrion Pharma Ltd.\tProliv Plus IV Infusion   500 ml bot 400\n\tIndication: Prevent nitrogen loss, Negative nitrogen balance, Nutritional therapy\n\nDose: For peripheral intravenous infusion, 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism. Infusion or ingestion of carbohydrate or lipid will not reduce the nitrogen sparing effect of intravenous amino acid infusions at this dose.\nAs with all intravenous fluid therapy, the primary aim is to provide sufficient water to compensate for insensible, urinary, and other fluid losses (nasogastric suction, fistula drainage, and diarrhea).  Infused at a rate of 45 mL/kg/day, will meet the fluid and amino acid requirements of the stable adult patient.\nAs reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia.\n\nContra-indication: This preparation should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.\n\nSide effects:  it can be infused through a peripheral vein paying great care to the possible occurrence of local reactions. Local reactions consisting of a warm sensation, erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids; in such cases the infusion site should be changed promptly to another vein. Use of large peripheral veins, inline filters, and slower rates of infusion may reduce the incidence of local venous irritation. Electrolyte additives should be spread throughout the day. Irritating additive medications may need to be injected at another venous site.\n\nGeneralized flushing, fever and nausea have been reported during peripheral infusions of amino acid solutions.\n\nPrecaution: Special care must be taken when administering glucose solutions to provide calories in diabetic or prediabetic patients. To control and minimize possible hyperglycemia and consequent glycosuria, it is desirable to monitor blood and urine glucose and, if necessary, add insulin.\n\nBecause of its antianabolic activity, concurrent administration of tetracycline may reduce the nitrogen sparing effects of infused amino acids.\n\nFeeding regimens which include amino acids should be used with caution in patients with history of renal disease, pulmonary disease, or with cardiac insufficiency so as to avoid excessive fluid accumulation.\n\nNitrogen intake should be carefully monitored in patients with impaired renal function.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

Rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia, muscle cramps.Potentially Fatal: Hypotension, bradycardia, conductive system delay and CCF.\n\nPrecaution: Impaired liver or renal function, CHF, sick-sinus syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis. Caution when used in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Elderly, children. Pregnancy, lactation.  Use in renal failure: Although Amlodipine is excreted primarily via kidney, mild renal impairment does not appear to have an effect on the plasma concentrations. Severe renal impairment may however require a dosage reduction. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Amlodipine half-life is prolonged in patient with impaired hepatic function. Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.\n\nMode of action: Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.

(For infants, the water should be freshly boiled and cooled before mixing with Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula). An infant's feeding bottle is a convenient measure of this volume. The solution should be made up immediately prior to feeding and any solution remaining an hour after reconstitution should be discarded. However, the solution may be used for up to 24 hours if stored in a refrigerator immediately after reconstitution. The reconstituted solution must not be boiled.\n\nContra-indication: There are no known contraindications to Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula. However, there may be a number of conditions where treatment with Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula will be inappropriate, e.g. intestinal obstruction requiring surgical intervention.\n\nSide effects: None reported.\n\nPrecaution: Use water ONLY to mix Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula powder or effervescent tablets. Never dilute with lemonade, soft drinks, cordials or any other fluid than water.\nGastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula powder is available with either sodium saccharin or aspartame as a sweetening agent.

The contents of one sachet or two effervescent tablets should always be made up to 200ml with water (the product must not be reconstituted in diluents other than water, e.g. must not be included in milk solutions). A weaker solution than recommended will fail to provide adequate sugar and electrolytes and a stronger solution than recommended may give rise to hypernatraemia. Intravenous rehydration is required for dehydrated children with shock, very large stool losses (>10mL/kg/hour), severe vomiting that interferes with oral fluid replacement, or glucose malabsorption. Patients with gastroenteritis should be monitored carefully to ensure that their condition does not deteriorate. In particular, young infants may become severely dehydrated in a short time.\nPatients and/or parents should be advised to seek medical advice if the condition worsens. Clinicians should particularly ensure patients are aware of the risk of dehydration in young children and infants. Early warning signs of impending dehydration should be discussed.\nSeek medical advice if diarrhoea persists for more than 6 hours in infants under 6 months, 12 hours in children aged 6 months to 3 years, 24 hours in children aged 3 to 6 years and 48 hours in children over 6 years of age.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

Intraoral inj may cause stress reactions such as diaphoresis, palpitation, hyperventilation, generalised pallor and faintness. \nTopically: papules, burns, rash, skin irritation, burning sensation and blanching.\nPotentially Fatal: CNS toxicity (due to inadvertent IV admin), medullary depression with tonic & clonic convulsions; ventricular fibrillation; severe hypertension with cerebral haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema; unconsciousness; possibly respiratory arrest. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and possibly life threatening asthmatic episodes in susceptible patients may occur due to sodium metabisulphate constituent. Central nerve blocks may cause CV depression (especially in hypovolaemia). Retrobulbar inj may reach subarachnoid space causing CV collapse, apnoea, convulsions, temporary blindness. Paracervical block may cause foetal bradycardia/tachycardia (careful monitoring of foetal heart rate is necessary).\n\nPrecaution: Epilepsy, impaired cardiac conduction, CHF, DM, closed angle glaucoma, impaired liver function (if site of admin is likely to result in high blood levels), severe renal dysfunction. Local anaesthetic effect may be reduced if injected into an inflamed or infected area. Cerebrovascular insufficiency, hyperthyroidism. Neonates, elderly, patients in poor general condition (optimise patient's condition before major block), pregnancy.\n\nMode of action: The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonists, or tricyclic antidepressants may produce severe, prolonged hypertension. Phenothiazines and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of epinephrine. Concurrent use of these agents should be avoided; however, in situations when concurrent therapy is necessary, careful patient monitoring is essential.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing epinephrine to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors, nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonists, or tricyclic antidepressants may produce severe, prolonged hypertension.

Adverse reactions that may be expected based on experience with other water-soluble vitamin compounds administered intravenously include: allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis; dermatological reactions including flushing, erythema and pruritus and CNS reactions including headache, dizziness and agitation etc.\n\nPrecaution: Folic acid may mask the symptoms of pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurologic manifestations remain progressive. Administering folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia. Recommended doses are insufficient to correct severe vitamin deficiency states and may be insufficient in patients with markedly increased vitamin requirements. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), routine supplementation with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is recommended to prevent deficiency states and to obviate the need to speculate on individual vitamin status. Daily vitamin requirements must be calculated to avoid over dosage and toxic effects, especially with regards to vitamins A & D and particularly in pediatric patients. \n\nIn patients for whom total parenteral nutrition is continued for prolonged periods (months or years), periodic monitoring of blood vitamin levels should be considered. To prevent excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins and for reasons of safety, daily dosage should be administered over a number of hours. \n\nMode of action: Decreased GI tract absorption with neomycin, aminosalicylic acid, H2-blockers and colchicine. Reduced serum concentrations with oral contraceptives. Reduced effects in anaemia with parenteral chloramphenicol.\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction: Decreased GI tract absorption with neomycin, aminosalicylic acid, H2-blockers and colchicine.

Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12.\n\nContra-indication:  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms.\n\nSide effects:  Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn and vomiting) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Reducing the dose and administering it with meals will minimize these effects in the sensitive patient. Increasing fiber in the diet can relieve constipation. Iron may turn stools black. This is a harmless effect that is a result of unabsorbed iron. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Integra FTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Integra FTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime.\n\nPrecaution: General: Anemia is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes. No single regimen fits all cases and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential. Blood examinations including hemoglobin and hematacrit should be done at the usual intervals to make certain that therapy is adequate. Use with care in the presence of peptic ulcer, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg -0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.\n\nMode of action: Iron: Antacids may decrease the absorption of carbonyl iron.\n\nFolic acid: Antiepileptics, oral contraceptives, anti-TB drugs, alcohol, aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim and sulphonamides may result to decrease in serum folate contrations. Decreases serum phenytoin concentrations.\n\nVit C: Deferroxamine, hormonal contraceptives, flufenazine, warfarin, elemental iron, salicylates, warfarin, fluphenazine, disulfiram, mexiletine, vitamin B12.\n\n\n\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Iron: Antacids may decrease the absorption of carbonyl iron.\n\nFolic acid: Antiepileptics, oral contraceptives, anti-TB drugs, alcohol, aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim and sulphonamides may result to decrease in serum folate contrations.

May initiate 40 mg once daily in patients who require >45% reduction in LDL-cholesterol. Max: 80 mg/day.\n\nChild: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: 10-17 yr 10 mg once daily, may increase at intervals of at least 4 wk to max 20 mg/day.\nElderly: No dosage adjustment needed.\n\nAtorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. Therapy should be individualized according to goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of Atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the LDL-C levels should be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should total-C be used to monitor therapy. \n\nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage of Atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (eg, LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. \n\nDosage in Patients with Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary. \n\nPediatric Use: Treatment experience in a pediatric population is limited to doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day for 1 year in 8 patients with homozygous FH. No clinical or biochemical abnormalities were reported in these patients. None of these patients was below 9 years of age. \n\nGeriatric Use: Treatment experience in adult’s age 70 years with doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day has been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of Atorvastatin in this population were similar to those of patients <70 years of age.\n\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity, active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminase, porphyria, pregnancy, lactation.\n\nSide effects: Headache, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, xerostomia, angioedema, myalgia, rash/pruritus, alopecia, allergy, infection, chest pain.Potentially Fatal: Thrombocytopenia. Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.\n\nPrecaution: Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. History of liver disease. Patients with risk factors for myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Hypothyroidism should be properly managed prior to starting statin therapy. Children <10 yr. Premenarcheal females.\n\nMode of action: May increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis w/ CYP3A4 potent inhibitor (e.g. HIV or HCV protease inhibitors, itraconazole, clarithromycin), fenofibrate, colchicines, fixed combination of lopinavir/ritonavir. May decrease plasma concentration w/ CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. rifampicin, efavirenz). May significantly increase AUC and peak plasma concentration of digoxin. Increased AUC for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.\nPotentially Fatal: Increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis w/ ciclosporin, gemfibrozil, telaprevir, tipranavir.\n\nPregnancy category: X\n\nInteraction: May increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis w/ CYP3A4 potent inhibitor (e.g. HIV or HCV protease inhibitors, itraconazole, clarithromycin), fenofibrate, colchicines, fixed combination of lopinavir/ritonavir. May decrease plasma concentration w/ CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. rifampicin, efavirenz). May significantly increase AUC and peak plasma concentration of digoxin.

Bacitracin Zinc + Neomycin Sulphate + Polymixin B	\n\n\tBio Pharma Ltd.\tNuba Plus Ointment   10gm  tube 30.11\n\tGeneral\tNeogen PLUS Ointment   10gm  tube 30.11\n\tOpsonin Pharma\tNeocin Plus Ointment   10gm  tube 30\n\tSquare\tNebanol PLUS Ointment  400 IU + 3.5 mg + 5000 I 10gm  tube 30.11\n\tIndication: Minor cuts, Scrapes, Burns, Eczematoid dermatitis, Neurodermatitis, Eczema, Anogenital pruritus, Impetigo, Contact dermatitis, Bacterial skin infections\n\nDose: Apply the ointment in the affected eye every 3 or 4 hours, depending on the severity of the condition. Not more than 8 grams should be prescribed initially and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in precaution above.\n\nContra-indication: Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate ophthalmic ointment is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including: epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate ophthalmic ointment is also contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components. Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components.\n\nSide effects: Adverse reactions have occurred with corticosteroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the corticosteroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. The exact incidence is not known. Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredient are allergic sensitization reactions including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . \n\nMore serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. The reactions due to the corticosteroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.\n\nSecondary Infection: The development of the secondary ocular infection has occurred after use of combinations containing corticosteroids and antimicrobials. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of a corticosteroid. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where corticosteroid treatment has been used . Local irritation on installation has been reported.\n\nPrecaution:  The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 8 grams should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. \n\nAs fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term corticosteroid applications, fungal invasion should be suspected in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. \n\nThere have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of topical ophthalmic products in multiple-dose containers which have been inadvertently contaminated by patients, most of whom had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. \n\nAllergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.\n\nMode of action: Bacitracin Zinc: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity when used with other nephrotoxic drugs. May enhance the action of neuromuscular-blocking agents.\n\nNeomycin Sulphate: Additive nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effect w/ other aminoglycosides (e.g. paromomycin), bacitracin, cisplatin, vancomycin, amphotericin B, polymyxin B, colistin and viomycin. Enhanced toxicity w/ potent diuretics (e.g. ethacrynic acid, furosemide). May impair the absorption of other drugs (e.g. phenoxymethylpenicillin, digoxin, methotrexate and some vit). May reduce the efficacy of OCs. May enhance the effect of acarbose. May enhance the effect of non-depolarising muscle relaxants. May antagonise the parasympathomimetic effect of neostigmine and pyridostigmine. May increase the risk of hypocalcaemia in patients receiving bisphosphonates. May alter INR when given w/ anticoagulants. May inactivate oral typhoid vaccine.\n\nPolymixin B: Potentially Fatal: Additive neurotoxic or nephrotoxic effect w/ bacitracin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, cephaloridine, paromomycin, viomycin, colistin. Increased risk of resp paralysis w/ neuromuscular blockers (e.g. anaesthetics, muscle relaxants).\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Bacitracin Zinc: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity when used with other nephrotoxic drugs. May enhance the action of neuromuscular-blocking agents.\n\nNeomycin Sulphate: Additive nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effect w/ other aminoglycosides (e.g. paromomycin), bacitracin, cisplatin, vancomycin, amphotericin B, polymyxin B, colistin and viomycin.

Severe reactions (approximately 1 in 1,000,000) and fatalities (approximately 1 in 10,000,000) have occurred. Procedural complications are rare, but may include aspiration pneumonitis, barium sulfate impaction, granuloma formation, intravasation, embolization and peritonitis following intestinal perforation, vasovagal and syncopal episodes, and fatalities. It is of the utmost importance to be completely prepared to treat any such occurrence.\n\nPrecaution: Diagnostic procedures which involve the use of radiopaque contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel with the requisite training and with a thorough knowledge of the particular procedure to be performed. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, as evidenced by hay fever and eczema, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent, warrant special attention. Caution should be exercised with the use of radiopaque media in severely debilitated patients and in those with marked hypertension or advanced cardiac disease.\n\nIngestion of this product is not recommended in patients with a history of food aspiration. If barium studies are required in these patients or in patients in whom integrity of the swallowing mechanism is unknown, proceed with caution. If this product is aspirated into the larynx, further administration should be immediately discontinued.\n\nAfter any barium study of the GI tract, it is important to rehydrate the patient as quickly as possible to prevent impaction of the bowel by barium sulfate. To prevent barium sulfate impaction in the bowel, the use of mild laxatives such as milk of magnesia or lactulose, following completion of the examination may also be required. These mild laxatives are recommended on a routine basis and in patients with a history of constipation unless contraindicated.\n\nUse with caution in patients with complete or nearly complete obstruction of the GI tract.\n\nMode of action: \n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

Calcitriol  can be administered orally either 0.25 mcg or 0.50 mcg.\n\nPostmenopausal osteoporosis\nThe recommended dosage is 0.25 mcg twice daily or 0.50 mcg once daily. Serum creatinine levels should be determined at 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months and 6 monthly intervals thereafter.\n\nRenal osteodystrophy (Dialysis patients)\nThe recommended initial dose of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day. Patients with normal or only slightly reduced serum calcium levels may respond to Calcitriol doses of 0.25 mcg every other day. Most patients undergoing hemodialysis respond to doses between 0.5 and 1 mcg/day.\n\nHypoparathyroidism & Rickets\nThe recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day given in the morning. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased at 2 to 4 week intervals.\n\nPredialysis patients:\nThe recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day in adults and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. This dosage may be increased if necessary to 0.5 mcg/day.\nChild dose: 1 month - 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 10 to 15 ng/kg/day.\n\nInjection\nThe recommended intravenous initial dose of Calcitriol injection, depending on the severity of the hypocalcemia and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism, is 1 mcg (0.02 mcg/kg) to 2 mcg administered three times weekly, approximately every other day. Doses as small as 0.5 mcg and as large as 4 mcg three times weekly have been used as an initial dose. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 1 mcg at two to four week intervals. \n\nContra-indication: Hypercalcaemia; evidence of vitamin D toxicity. Pregnancy (dose exceeding RDA). Lactation.\n\nSide effects: Adverse events associated with Calcitriol therapy are similar to those encountered with excess vitamin D intake, i.e. hypercalcemia syndrome, or calcium intoxication.\n\nOccasional acute symptoms include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or stomach ache and constipation.\n\nPrecaution: Idiopathic hypercalcaemia. Pediatric doses must be individualised and monitored under close medical supervision. Coronary disease, renal function impairment and arteriosclerosis, especially in the elderly. Hypoparathyroidism.\nExcessive dosage of Calcitriol induces hypercalcemia and in some instances hypercalciuria; therefore, early in treatment during dosage adjustment, serum calcium should be determined twice weekly. \nPatients with normal renal function who are taking Calcitriol should avoid dehydration. Adequate fluid intake should be maintained.\n\nMode of action: Hypermagnesaemia may develop in patients on chronic renal dialysis. Hypercalcaemia in patients on digitalis may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. Intestinal absorption of calcitriol may be reduced by cholestyramine and colestipol.

It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Colecalciferol (or medicines of the same class) and any of the constituent excipients. Colecalciferol is contraindicated if there is evidence of vitamin D toxicity.\n\nSide effects: Generally all nutritional supplements are considered to be safe and well tolerable. However, few side-effects can generally occur including hypercalcaemia syndrome or Calcium intoxication (depending on the severity and duration of hypercalcaemia), occasional acute symptoms include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or stomach ache and constipation with the administration of Colecaciferol.\n\nPrecaution: People with the following conditions should exercise caution when considering taking vitamin D supplements:\nHigh blood Calcium or Phosphorus level\nHeart problems\nKidney disease\n\nVitamin D must be taken with adequate amounts of both Calcium and Magnesium supplementation. When Calcium level is low (due to insufficient vitamin D and calcium intake), the body activates the parathyroid gland, which produces PTH (parathyroid hormone). This hormone kick starts vitamin D hormone production and assists removal of Calcium from the bones to be used in more important functions such as neutralizing body acidity.\n\nMode of action: Increased risk of hypercalcaemia if given with thiazide diuretics, calcium or phosphate. Antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin & primidone) may increase vitamin D requirements. Rifampicin & isoniazid may reduce efficacy of vitamin D.

Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial.\n\nFollowing prolonged therapy, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in symptoms of the corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome including fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise.  This may occur in patients even without evidence of adrenal insufficiency.\n\nThere is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis.\n\nCorticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex for fear of corneal perforation.\n\nThe lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction must be gradual.\n\nPsychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations.  Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.\n\nAspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.\n\nSteroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection, also in diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis.  \n\nWhen large doses are given, some authorities advise that antacids be administered between meals to help to prevent peptic ulcer.\n\nGrowth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully followed.\n\nSteroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients.\n\nPhenytoin, phenobarbital, ephedrine, and rifampin may enhance the metabolic clearance of corticosteroids resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring adjustment in corticosteroid dosage.  These interactions may interfere with dexamethasone suppression tests which should be interpreted with caution during administration of these drugs.\n\nWhen corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting diuretics, patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia.\n\nIntra-articular injection of a corticosteroid may produce systemic as well as local effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMode of action:  	Increased risk of hypokalaemia when used concurrently with potassium-depleting drugs such as amphotericin B and loop diuretics. Reduces efficacy of isoniazid, salicylates, vaccines and toxoids. Increased activity of dexamethasone and cyclosporin when used together. Concurrent use with aspirin or ethanol may lead to increased GI side effects.\nPotentially Fatal: Reduced efficacy in combination with ephedrine, cholestyramine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and rifampicin.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:  	Increased risk of hypokalaemia when used concurrently with potassium-depleting drugs such as amphotericin B and loop diuretics.

Dextran 70 6% + Dextrose 5%	\n\n\tIndication: Hypovolaemic shock, Pulmonary embolism, Venous thrombosis, Open heart surgery\n\nDose: DextranI/V should be administered prior to administration of clinical dextran solutions.\n\n    In shock, it is suggested that total dosage not exceed 20 mL/kg for adults and adolescents, during the first 24 hours. The first 10 mL/kg may be infused as rapidly as necessary to effect improvement. It is strongly recommended that central venous pressure be monitored frequently during the initial infusion of the drug. Should therapy continue beyond 24 hours, subsequent dosage should not exceed 10 mL/kg per day and therapy should not continue beyond five days.\n\n  In prophylaxis of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, the dosage  for adults and adolescents, should be chosen according to the risk of thromboembolic complications, e.g., type of surgery and duration of immobilization. In general, treatment should be initiated during surgery; 500 to 1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg of body weight) should be administered on the day of operation. Treatment should be continued at a dose of 500 mL daily for an additional two to three days; then, according to the risk of complications, 500 mL may be given every second or third day during the period of risk, for up to two weeks.\n\n    Infants may be given 5 mL per kg body weight and children 10 mL per kg.\n\n\n\nContra-indication: Patients with known hypersensitivity to dextran, in those with marked hemostatic defects of all types (thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, etc.) including those caused by drugs (heparin, warfarin, etc.), marked cardiac decompensation and in renal disease with severe oliguria or anuria.\n\nSide effects: Because of the seriousness of anaphylactoid reactions, it is recommended that the infusion of intravenous dextran be stopped at the first sign of an allergic reaction provided that other means of sustaining the circulation are available. Resuscitative measures should be readily available for emergency administration in the event such a reaction occurs. In circulatory collapse due to anaphylaxis, rapid volume substitutions with an agent other than dextran should be instituted.\n\nPrecaution: The possibility of circulatory overload should be kept in mind. Special care should be exercised in patients with impaired renal clearance of dextran. When the risk of pulmonary edema and/or congestive heart failure may be increased, dextran should be used with caution.\n\nIn patients with normal hemostasis, dosage of LMD (dextran 40) approximating 15 mL/kg of body weight may prolong bleeding time and depress platelet function. Dosages in this range also markedly decrease factor VIII, and decrease factors V and IX to a greater degree than would be expected to occur from hemodilution alone. Since these changes tend to be more pronounced following trauma or major surgery, patients should be observed for early signs of bleeding complications.\n\nSince increased rouleaux formation may occur in the presence of dextran, it is recommended that blood samples be drawn for typing and cross-matching prior to the infusion of dextran and reserved for subsequent use if necessary. If blood is drawn after infusion of dextran, the saline agglutination and indirect antiglobulin methods may be used for typing and cross-matching. Difficulty may be encountered when proteolytic enzyme techniques are used to match blood.\n\nConsideration should be given to withdrawal of blood for chemical laboratory tests prior to initiating therapy with dextran because of the following:\n\n    Blood sugar determinations that employ high concentrations of acid may result in hydrolysis of dextran, yielding falsely elevated glucose assay results. This has been observed both with sulfuric acid and with acetic acid.\n\n    In other laboratory tests, the presence of dextran in the blood may result in the development of turbidity, which can interfere with the assay. This has been observed in bilirubin assays in which alcohol is employed and in total protein assays employing biuret reagent.\n\nSolutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.\n\nCaution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.\n\nDo not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. \n\nMode of action: Dextran: Enzyme inducers e.g. phenytoin or carbamazepine and enzyme inhibitors e.g. cimetidine. Sodium Chloride: May affect serum concentrations of lithium.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Dextran: Enzyme inducers e.g. phenytoin or carbamazepine and enzyme inhibitors e.g. cimetidine. Sodium Chloride: May affect serum concentrations of lithium.

Dextrose 10% + Sodium Chloride 0.9%	\n\n\tIndication: Dehydration, Fluid and Electrolytes imbalance\n\nDose: These solutions are for intravenous use only.\n\nDosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy.\n\nWhen a hypertonic solution is to be administered peripherally, it should be slowly infused through a small bore needle, placed well within the lumen of a large vein to minimize venous irritation. Carefully avoid infiltration.\n\nIn the average adult, daily requirements of sodium and chloride are met by the infusion of one liter of fluid containing 0.9% sodium chloride (154 mEq each of sodium and chloride).\n\nFluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient.\n\nSome additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.\n\nParenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n\nContra-indication: These solutions are contraindicated where the administration of sodium or chloride could be clinically detrimental.\n\nSolutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to corn products.\n\nSide effects: Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.\n\nToo rapid infusion of hypertonic solutions may cause local pain and venous irritation. Rate of administration should be adjusted according to tolerance. Use of the largest peripheral vein and a small bore needle is recommended. \n\nSymptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.\n\nHypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water, resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume. If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecaution: These solutions should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation. \n\nSodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients. Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.\n\nInfusion of more than one liter of isotonic (0.9%) sodium chloride per day  can exceed normal tolerance, resulting in hypernatremia; this may also cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.\n\nSolutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus, or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason. Hypokalemia may develop during parenteral administration of hypertonic dextrose solutions. Sufficient amounts of potassium should be added to dextrose solutions administered to fasting patients with good renal function, especially those on digitalis therapy.\n\nThese solutions are intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

In severe cases (e.g. colic) the daily dose can exceptionally be increased to two ampoules of 75 mg, separated by an interval of a few hours. Alternatively, one ampoule of 75 mg can be combined with other dosage forms (tablets, suppositories) up to a maximum daily dosage of 150 mg.\n\nIn migraine attacks, clinical experience is limited to initial use of 1 ampoule of 75 mg administered as soon as possible, followed by suppositories up to 100 mg on the same day if required. The total dosage should not exceed 175 mg on the first day.\n\nChildren: In juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac sodium/kg body weight daily in divided doses.\n\nElderly patients: The lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status or as prescribed by the physician.\n\nSuppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg. \n\nContra-indication: It is contra-indicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibitinig activity, it is also contraindicated.\nBecause of the presence of Lidocaine, it is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. \n\nSide effects: Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage).

Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued. Use of Diclofenac tablet in patients with hepatic porphyria may trigger an attack.\n\nMode of action:  May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol.

Following the initiation of a constant rate infusion, or upon changing the rate, a steady-state dobutamine plasma concentration is achieved within approximately 10 minutes. Thus, loading doses or bolus injections are not necessary and are not recommended. \n\nRecommended Dosage The rate of infusion needed to increase cardiac output has ranged from 2.5 to 10 mcg/kg/min in the majority of patients. Frequently, doses up to 20 mcg/kg/min are required for adequate haemodynamic improvement. \n\nThe rate of administration and the duration of therapy should be adjusted according to the patient's response, The indicators are: haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and rhythm, arterial pressure, and, whenever possible, cardiac output and measurements of ventricular filling pressures and signs of pulmonary congestion. \n\nConcentrations up to 5,000 mg/L have been administered to humans. The final volume administered should be determined by the fluid requirements of the patient. Rather than abruptly discontinuing therapy with Dobutamine Hydrochloride, it is often advisable to decrease the dosage gradually. Rates of Infusion Based on Concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride The rates of fluid infusion that are required to deliver specific dosages are a function of the concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride in the infusate.\n\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity; idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS).\n\nSide effects: Increased heart rate and BP, ectopic beats, palpitation. Nausea, headache, chest pain, palpitation, dyspnoea, paraesthesia, leg cramps. Tissue necrosis at site of extravasation.\nPotentially Fatal: Cardiac arrhythmias, allergy (rare), MI and hypotension.\n\nPrecaution: Correct hypovolaemia prior to treatment. Increased risk of rapid ventricular response in patients with atrial fibrillation. Insufficient data to determine the safety and efficacy of dobutamine use after acute MI. Elderly. Neonates. Pregnancy.\n\nMode of action: Increased cardiac output when used with nitroprusside. Increased vasopressor effect of dobutamine when used with bretylium, guanethidine, oxytocic drugs or TCAs.\n\nPregnancy category: B\n\nInteraction: Increased cardiac output when used with nitroprusside.

Patients should be given the following single daily dose of either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.\n\nThe total dosage requirement of rifampicin is 10 (8 to 12) mglkg/day, of isoniazid 5 (4 to 6) mglkglday, of pyrazinamide 25 (20 to 30) mglkg/day and of ethambutol 15 (15-20) mglkg/day.\n\nNew patients:\nBody weight < 50kg, initial 2•months- Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily; next 4 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 450mg + Isoniazid 300mg daily.\n\nBody weight >50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily; next 4 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 600mg + Isoniazid 300mg at a time daily.\n\nRe-treatment patients:\nBody weight < 50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily, & Streptomycin 15mg/kg daily; next 1 month Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily; next 5 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 450mg + Isoniazid 300mg daily, & Ethambutol 400mg 2 tablets (800mg) at a time daily.\n\nBody weight >50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily, & Streptomycin 15mg/kg daily; next 1 month Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily; next 5 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 600mg + Isoniazid 300mg at a time daily, & Ethambutol 400mg 2 1/2 tablets (1000mg) at a time daily.\n\n\nContra-indication: Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide or any of the components, or to any of the rifamycins. \n\nSide effects: No serious adverse events were reported in the patients receiving   tablets. Three serious adverse events were reported in the patients given isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide as separate tablets and capsules. The three serious adverse events were two general hypersensitivity reactions and one jaundice reaction.\n\nPrecaution: For treatment of tuberculosis, rifampin is usually administered on a daily basis. Doses of rifampin (>600 mg) given once or twice weekly have resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including the "flu syndrome" (fever, chills and malaise); hematopoietic reactions (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or acute hemolytic anemia); cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and hepatic reactions; shortness of breath; shock, anaphylaxis, and renal failure. Recent studies indicate that regimens using twice-weekly doses of rifampin 600 mg plus isoniazid 15 mg/kg are much better tolerated.\n\nRifampin is not recommended for intermittent therapy; the patient should be cautioned against intentional or accidental interruption of the daily dosage regimen since rare renal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported when therapy was resumed in such cases.\n\nMode of action: Rifampicin: Induces microsomal enzymes (accelerates clearance of methadone, oral anticoagulants, glucocorticoids, oestrogen, oral hypoglycaemic agents, digitoxin, antiarrhythmics, theophylline, anticonvulsants, ?-blockers, azole antifungal, cyclosporin). \nINH: Inhibits metabolism of antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, warfarin, theophylline.

Events of anemia and edema tended to be reported more frequently at higher doses, angioedema and urticaria have been reported rarely.\n\n\nPrecaution: Hypoglycemia: All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal, pituitary\n, renal, or hepatic insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose lowering drugs.\nLoss of Control of Blood Glucose:\nWhen a patient stabilized on any antidiabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a temporary loss of glycemic control may occur.\n\nEdema:\nCombination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients with edema.\nSince thiazolidinediones, including Rosiglitazone can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, Combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients at risk for heart failure.\nWeight Gain:\nDose-related weight gain was seen with Rosiglitazone alone and in combination with other hypoglycemic agents. \nHepatic Effects:\nLiver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical\njudgment of the healthcare professional. \n\nMode of action: Glimepiride: Salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, coumarin anticoagulants, probenecid, CYP2C9 inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, disopyramide, fluoxetine, quinolones, ACE inhibitors, MAOIs and ?-blockers may potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride. Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, oestrogens, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics and CYP2C9 inducers may reduce hypoglycaemic effect of glimepiride. Reduced plasma concentration w/ colesevelam.\n\nRosiglitazone: Increased plasma conc w/ gemfibrozil. Decreased plasma conc w/ rifampicin.\n\n\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Glimepiride: Salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, coumarin anticoagulants, probenecid, CYP2C9 inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, disopyramide, fluoxetine, quinolones, ACE inhibitors, MAOIs and ?-blockers may potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride.

Hydrocortisone Acetate 2.5% + Pramoxine 1% Topical	\n\n\tSquare\tPracort Cream    55\n\tSquare\tPracort Ointment    60\n\tIndication: Hemorrhoids, Insect bites, Skin irritations, Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, Anal itching\n\nDose: Topical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin film three to four times daily depending on the severity of the condition. Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.\n\nContra-indication: Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation.\n\nSide effects:  If the drug is absorbed in the system patient may feel blurred vision, halos around lights, irregular heart rate, insomnia. Redness, burning, itching and irritation may occur in application site.\n\nPrecaution: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.\n\nTherefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area and under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.\n\nRecovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity.  \n\nIf irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.\n\nIn the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

Most discolorations begin to lighten after 4 weeks of treatment but it may take longer. After desired bleaching, use only as needed to maintain results of treatment. Hydroquinone bleaching is faster, more dependable and easier if the treated area is protected from ultraviolet light. Therefore, exposure to sunlight should be minimized at the period of treatment. During day, an effective broad-spectrum sunscreen should be used, unnecessary solar exposure should be avoided and protective clothing should be used to prevent repigmentation of treated areas. After reduction of hyperpigmentation, use of sunscreen agents and/or protective clothing should continue.Use in children: Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.\n\nContra-indication: Hydroquinone is contraindicated to patients with prior history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to hydroquinone or other ingredients in the preparation.\n\nSide effects: No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur in which case the medication should be discontinued.\n\nPrecaution: Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin to check in 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, further treatment is not advised. If no bleaching or lightening effect is noted after 2 months of treatment, the medication should be discontinued.Contact with the eyes and lips should be avoided. Hydroquinone should not be applied to cut or abraded skin.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

Hydroxocobalamin	\n\n\tJayson\tCynomin H Injection 1mg/ml 10 amps pack 70.30\n\tIndication: Vitamin B12 deficiency, Cyanide poisoning\n\nDose: Thirty mcg daily for 5 to 10 days followed by 100 to 200 mcg monthly injected intramuscularly. If the patient is critically ill, or has neurologic disease, an infectious disease or hyperthyroidism, considerably higher doses may be indicated. However, current data indicate that the optimum obtainable neurologic response may be expected with a dosage of vitamin B12 sufficient to produce good hematologic response. Children may be given a total of 1 to 5 mg over a period of 2 or more weeks in doses of 100 mcg, then 30 to 50 mcg every 4 weeks for maintenance.\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.\n\nSide effects: Mild transient diarrhea, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of entire body, and anaphylaxis.\n\nA few patients may experience pain after injection of hydroxocobalamin.\n\nPrecaution: General\n\nThe validity of diagnostic vitamin B12 or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy.\n\nVitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid and since it might improve folic acid deficient megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12 could mask the true diagnosis.\n\nHypokalemia and thrombocytosis could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with B12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.\n\nMode of action: history of interaction with ARI Sodium Iodide (I123) 1-12 MBq (sodium iodide i-123)\nARI Sodium Iodide (I123) 100-750 MBq (sodium iodide i-123)\narsenic trioxide\nChloracol (chloramphenicol)\nchloramphenicol\nChloromycetin (chloramphenicol)\nChloromycetin Sodium Succinate (chloramphenicol)\nHicon (sodium iodide-i-131)\nIodotope (sodium iodide-i-131)\nsodium iodide i-123\nsodium iodide-i-131\nTrisenox (arsenic trioxide)\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: history of interaction with ARI Sodium Iodide (I123) 1-12 MBq (sodium iodide i-123)\nARI Sodium Iodide (I123) 100-750 MBq (sodium iodide i-123)\narsenic trioxide\nChloracol (chloramphenicol)\nchloramphenicol\nChloromycetin (chloramphenicol)\nChloromycetin Sodium Succinate (chloramphenicol)\nHicon (sodium iodide-i-131)\nIodotope (sodium iodide-i-131)\nsodium iodide i-123\nsodium iodide-i-131\nTrisenox (arsenic trioxide)

Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping are all side effects associated with imipramine usage in a small number of people.\n\nPrecaution: Imipramine should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when imipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines. Imipramine may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic dosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is increased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of pre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.\n\nMode of action: Increased plasma levels and effects with quinidine, cimetidine, SSRIs, propafenone, flecainide. Reduced plasma levels with barbiturates, phenytoin. May increase effects of anticholinergic drugs. Severe orthostatic hypotension with altretamine. Causes drowsiness and impaired performance in combination with alcohol.\nPotentially Fatal: Severe hypertension with adrenaline, noradrenaline and methylphenidate. Reduces hypotensive effects of guanethidine, bethanidine, debrisoquine, bretylium, methyldopa and clonidine. Possible serotonin syndrome with MAOIs, separate admin by 3 wk.\n\nPregnancy category: D\n\nInteraction: Increased plasma levels and effects with quinidine, cimetidine, SSRIs, propafenone, flecainide. Reduced plasma levels with barbiturates, phenytoin. May increase effects of anticholinergic drugs. Severe orthostatic hypotension with altretamine. Causes drowsiness and impaired performance in combination with alcohol.\nPotentially Fatal: Severe hypertension with adrenaline, noradrenaline and methylphenidate.

Polycystic ovary syndrome Initial: 500 mg/day in the morning for 1 wk, then 500 mg twice daily for 1 wk, then 1.5-1.7 g\n\nSide effects: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, wt loss, flatulence, occasional metallic taste; weakness; hypoglycaemia; rash, malabsorption of vit B12. Chest discomfort, flushing, palpitation, chills, headache, lightheadedness, indigestion, abdominal discomfort. Potentially Fatal: Lactic acidosis in presence of renal failure and alcoholism. Patients may experience a metallic taste and there may be weight loss, which in some diabetics could be an advantage.\n\nPrecaution: Caution when used in patients with CHF especially in those with unstable or acute heart failure. Risk of lactic acid accumulation increases with the degree of renal impairment. May need to discontinue treatment in patients with stress-related states e.g. fever, trauma, infection or surgery. Metformin should be temporarily discontinued for 48 hr in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular admin of iodinated contrast materials. Elderly. Monitor renal function regularly. Because of possibility of hypoglycemia in combination therapy with a sulphonylurea or insulin, diabetic control should be monitored by blood sugar readings.\n\nMode of action: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations.

It should not be initiated if the patients exhibit clinical evidence of active liver disease. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended in all patients prior to initiation of therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin and periodically thereafter. \n\nContra-indication: 1. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g. as suggested by serum creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dl in male, >1.4 mg/dl in females or abnormal creatinine clearance), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction and septicemia.\n2. Known hypersensitivity to Pioglitazone, Metformin or any other component of this combination.\n3. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without coma.\n\nSide effects: Generally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity.\n\nPrecaution: Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of insulin. Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases.\n\nMetformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive this combination.\n\nMode of action: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.\n\nPregnancy category: A\n\nInteraction: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas.

The dose may be increased by increment of 2 mg/500 mg per day to a maximum of 8 mg/2,000 mg per day in divided doses if patients are not adequately controlled after 4 weeks.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy, the usual starting dose  is 4 mg Rosiglitazone (daily dose) plus the dose of Metformin already being taken.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on Rosiglitazone monotherapy, the usual starting dose is 1000 mg Metformin (daily dose) plus the dose of Rosiglitazone already being taken.\n\nWhen switching from combination therapy of Rosiglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets, the usual starting dose  is the dose of Rosiglitazone and Metformin already being taken. If additional glycemic control is needed, the daily dose may be increased by increment of 4 mg Rosiglitazone and/or 500 mg Metformin, up to the maximum recommended total daily dose of 8 mg/2000 mg.\n\nContra-indication: It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by serum creatinine levels .1.5 mg/dl (males), 1.4 mg/dl (females), or abnormal creatinine clearance), acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma & known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone maleate or metformin HCl.\n\nSide effects: Rosiglitazone: The commonly reported adverse events are upper respiratory tract infections, injury, headache, back pain, fatigue, sinusitis, diarrhoea and hypoglycemia. There were a small number of patients who had anemia and edema. All these events were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment with Rosiglitazone.\nMetformin: Some patients may develop asymptomatic subnormal levels of serum vitamin B12.\nIncidence of lactic acidosis is also very rare. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, flatulence and anorexia are common reactions to Metformin.\n\nPrecaution: Rosiglitazone: should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. This should be used with caution in patients with edema. Dose-related weight gain was seen with rosiglitazone alone and rosiglitazone together with other hypoglycemic agents.\n\nMetformin: Monitoring of renal function: Patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal should not receive this tablet. In patients with advanced age, the dose should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. \n\nMode of action: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control.

However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.\n\nIt Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\n\nA. Administration for Local Effect\n\n1. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis. The dose for intra-articular administration depends upon the size of the joint and varies with the severity of the condition in the individual patient. In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection. The doses in the following table are given as a general guide:\n\nLarge Joint: Knees, Ankles & Shoulders:	20 to 80 mg\nMedium joint: Elbows & Wrists:	 10 to 40 mg\nSmall joint:  Metacarpophalangeal, Interphalangeal, Sternoclavicular & Acromioclavicular:  4 to 10 mg\n\n2. The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 to 30 mg. In recurrent or chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.\n\n3. Injections for Local Effect in Dermatologic Conditions. Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 to 60 mg of the suspension is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. \n\nB. Administration for Systemic Effect\n\nThe intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of methylprednisolone tablets is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.\n\nIn pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. The recommended dosage may be reduced for pediatric patients, but dosage should be governed by the severity of the condition rather than by strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.\n\nIn patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.\n\nFollowing intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks. Similarly, in patients with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks.\n\nIf signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.\n\nIn treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\n\n\nContra-indication: Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents.\n\nIntramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nMethylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route.\n\nMethylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions\n\nSide effects: The following adverse reactions have been reported with methylprednisolone acetate or other corticosteroids:\n\nAllergic Reactions\n\nAllergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema.\n\nCardiovascular\n\nBradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, circulatory collapse, congestive heart failure, fat embolism, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopthy in premature infants, myocardial rupture following recent mycocardial infarction , pulmonary edema, syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis.\n\nDermatologic\n\nAcne, allergic dermatitis, cutaneous and subcutaneous atrophy, dry scaly skin, ecchymoses and petechiae, edema, erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, impaired wound healing, increase sweating, rash, sterile abscess, striae, suppressed reactions to skin tests, thin fragile skin, thinning scalp hair, urticaria.\n\nEndocrine\n\nDecreased carbohydrate and glucose tolerance, development of cushingoid state, glycosuria, hirsutism, hypertrichosis, increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetes, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, menstrual irregularities, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness (particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery, or illness), suppression of growth in pediatric patients.\n\nFluid and Electrolyte Disturbances\n\nCongestive heart failure in susceptible patients, Fluid retention, hypokalemic alkalosis, potassium loss, sodium retention.\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nAbdominal distention, bowel/bladder dysfunction (after intrathecal administration), elevation in serum liver enzymes levels (usually reversible upon discontinuation), hepatomegaly, increased appetite, nausea, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer with possible subsequent perforation and hemorrhage, perforation of the small and large intestine (particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease), ulcerative esophagitis.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nAseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, calcinosis (following intra-articular or intra-lesional use), Charcot-like arthropathy, loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, pathologic fracture of long bones, postinjection flare (following intra-articular use), steroid myopathy, tendon rupture, vertebral compression fractures.\n\nNeurologic/Psychiatric\n\nConvulsions, depression, emotional instability, euphoria, headache, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri) usually following discontinuation of treatment, insomnia, mood swings, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia, personality changes, psychic disorders, vertigo.\n\nOphthalmic\n\nExophthalmoses, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecaution: General\n\nThe lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.\n\nSince complications of treatment with glucocorticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.\n\nKarposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.\n\nMode of action: Decreases effect of anticholinesterases in myasthenia gravis.

Nervous System\n\n    Acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis\n    \n\nDose: This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation.\n\nWhen high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours.\n\nIn general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.\n\nIn other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.\n\nIt should be emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. \nIf after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\n\nTo prepare solutions for intravenous infusion, first prepare the solution for injection as directed. This solution may then be added to indicate amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution.\n\nIn pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.\n\nDosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.\n\nIn treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\n\n\nContra-indication: Powder is also contraindicated in systemic fungal infections and patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents. Intramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route. Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions\n\nSide effects: The following adverse reactions have been reported with methylprednisolone acetate or other corticosteroids: Allergic Reactions Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema. Cardiovascular Bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, circulatory collapse, congestive heart failure, fat embolism, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopthy in premature infants, myocardial rupture following recent mycocardial infarction , pulmonary edema, syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis.

Ophthalmic Exophthalmoses, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts. \n\nPrecaution: General The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Karposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.\n\nSteroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency;  hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis.\n\nGrowth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.\n\nMode of action: Decreases effect of anticholinesterases in myasthenia gravis. May decrease the hypoglycaemic effects of antidiabetic agents. Decreases serum concentrations of salicylates. Increased hypokalemic effects of potassium-depleting diuretics (thiazides or furosemide), amphotericin B, bronchodilator therapy with xanthines or ?2 agonists.

Neomycin Sulphate 0.5% + Prednisolone 0.5% E/E prep	\n\n\tRenata\tDeltasone N Eye/Ear Drops   5  ml drop 39.98\n\tIndication: Bacterial ocular infection, otitis externa\n\nDose:  Instill 1 or 2 drops every 3 or 4 hours, or more frequently as required. Acute infections may require administration every 30 minutes, with frequency of administration reduced as the infection is brought under control. \n\n\n\nContra-indication: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of the ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication. (Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components.)\n\nThe use of these combinations is always contraindicated after uncomplicated removal of a corneal foreign body.\n\nSide effects: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available since no denominator of treated patients is available.\n\nReactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredients are allergic sensitizations including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . More serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. The reactions due to the steroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.\n\nAlthough systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical steroids.\n\nCorticosteroid-containing preparations have also been reported to cause perforation of the globe. Keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and conjunctival hyperemia have occasionally been reported following local use of steroids.\n\nSecondary infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used.\n\nSecondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.\n\nPrecaution: The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 20 milliliters should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.\n\nThe possibility of persistent fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged steroid dosing.\n\nAs with other antimicrobial preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated.\n\n . If purulent discharge, inflammation, or pain becomes aggravated, the patient should discontinue use of the medicatioin and consult a physician.\n\nAllergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.\n\nMode of action: Synergistic effects with penicillins. Additive toxicity with neurotoxic, ototoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. May decrease absorption of digoxin and methotrexate. May increase effects of oral anticoagulants.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Synergistic effects with penicillins. Additive toxicity with neurotoxic, ototoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. May decrease absorption of digoxin and methotrexate. May increase effects of oral anticoagulants.

May also be given by IM or slow IV inj.\n\nHyperlipidaemias\nAdult: As immediate-release preparation: Initially, 600 mg daily in 3 divided doses, gradually increased over 2-4 wk to max 6 g daily (usual dose 1-2 g bid-tid). As modified-release preparation: Initially, 375 or 500 mg at night gradually increased by no more that 500 mg in 4 wk according to patient's response. Maintenance: 1-2 g at bedtime.\n\nVasodilation\nAdult: As immediate-release preparation: 100-150 mg 3-5 times daily. As extended release preparation: 300-400 mg 12 hrly.\n\n\n\nContra-indication: Niacin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Niacin or any component of this medication, significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction, active peptic ulcer disease or arterial bleeding.\n\nSide effects: Niacin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions have been mild and transient.The most frequent advers effects were flushing, itching, pruritis, nausea and GI upset, jaundice ,hypotension, tachycardia, increased serum blood glucose and uric acid levels, myalgia.\n\nPrecaution: Before instituting therapy with Niacin, an attempt should be made to control hyperlipidemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients and to treat other underlying medical problems. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during Niacin therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in glucose intolerance, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary.\n\nCaution should also be used when Niacin is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers or adrenergic blocking agents. Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with Niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count and increases in prothrombin time. Caution should be observed when Niacin is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time and platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). So phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

Max total dose: 30 units in a 12-hr period.\n\nPostpartum haemorrhage\nAdult: 10-40 units by infusion in 1000 mL of IV fluid at a rate sufficient to control uterine atony.\n\nLabour induction\nAdult: 1-2 milliunits/minute, may increase at intervals of at least 30 minutes until a max of 3-4 contractions occur every 10 minutes. Not to exceed 32 milliunits/minute and no more than a total of 5 units should be given in 1 day. Not to be given within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Monitor uterine contractions and foetal heart rate continuously. Withdraw gradually once labour is progressing.\n\nOxytocin challenge test for evaluating of foetal distress\nAdult: Dilute 5-10 units in 1 L of 5% dextrose inj. Initially, administer the drug in the mother via IV infusion at a rate of 0.5 milliunits/minute. May gradually increase infusion rate at intervals of 15-30 minutes. Max: 20 milliunits/minute. Monitor foetal heart rate and uterine contractions immediately before and during infusion. Discontinue infusion when 3 moderate uterine contractions occur within one 10-minute interval. Compare baseline and oxytocin-induced foetal heart rates. If no change occurs, repeat the test in 1 wk. Termination of pregnancy may be required if a late deceleration in foetal heart rate occurs.\n\nContra-indication: Cephalopelvic disproportion; abnormal presentation of the foetus; hydraminios; multiparae; previous caesarian section or other uterine surgery; hyperactive or hypertonic uterus, uterine rupture; contraindicated vaginal delivery (invasive cervical cancer, active genital herpes, prolapse of the cord, cord presentation, total placenta previa or vasa previa); foetal distress where delivery is not imminent; severe pre-eclamptic toxaemia.\n\nSide effects: Foetus or neonate: Jaundice; arrhythmias, bradycardia; brain, CNS damage; seizure; retinal haemorrhage; low Apgar score. Mother: transient hypotension, reflex tachycardia; nasal irritation, rhinorrhoea, lachrymation (following nasal admin); uterine bleeding, violent contractions, hypertonicity; spasm; nausea, vomiting.\nPotentially Fatal: Maternal water intoxication (especially with slow infusion over 24 hr); prolonged uterine contractions causing foetal hypoxia and death; rupture of gravid uterus; afibrinogenaemia; subarachnoid haemorrhage\n\nPrecaution: CV disorders; >35 yr; lactation. Monitor foetal and maternal heart rate, maternal BP and uterine motility. Monitor fluid intake and output during treatment. Discontinute immediately if the uterus is hypertonic or hyperactive or if there is foetal distress. Use of nasal spray may produce maternal dependence on its effects. IM admin not regularly used due to unpredictable effects of oxytocin. Not to be used for prolonged periods in resistant uterine inertia, severe pre-eclampsia, or severe CV disorders. Risk of water intoxication when used at high doses for prolonged periods.\n\nMode of action: Possible severe hypertension if given within 3-4 hr of vasoconstrictor in association with a caudal block anaesthesia. Cyclopropane anaesthesia may increase risk of hypotension and maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal AV rhythms. Dinoprostone and misoprostol may increase uterotonic effect of oxytocin, thus oxytocin should not be used within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Concurrent use may increase the vasopressor effect of sympathomimetics.\n\nPotentially Fatal: Concomitant use with prostaglandins increases risk of uterine rupture and cervical lacerations.\n\nPregnancy category: X\n\nInteraction: Possible severe hypertension if given within 3-4 hr of vasoconstrictor in association with a caudal block anaesthesia. Cyclopropane anaesthesia may increase risk of hypotension and maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal AV rhythms. Dinoprostone and misoprostol may increase uterotonic effect of oxytocin, thus oxytocin should not be used within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Concurrent use may increase the vasopressor effect of sympathomimetics.\n\nPotentially Fatal: Concomitant use with prostaglandins increases risk of uterine rupture and cervical lacerations.

Patients with baseline neutropenia of <1500 cells/mm3 (<1000 cells/mm3 for kaposi's sarcoma). Pregnancy and lactation. In kaposi's sarcoma, contraindicated in patients with concurrent, serious, uncontrolled infections.\n\n\nSide effects: Neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, bleeding; hypersensitivity reactions (dyspnoea, flushing, chest pain, tachycardia, rash, hypotension, hypertension); bradycardia, abnormal ECG; neurotoxicity (mainly peripheral neuropathy), myalgia, arthralgia; nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea; severe mucositis, alopecia; rarely hepatic necrosis and encephalopathy, inj site reactions e.g. erythema, tenderness, skin discolouration, swelling; interstitial pneumonitis; infections (mainly UTIs and upper respiratory tract); mucosal inflammation, severe elevation in LFTs (aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase).\nPotentially Fatal: Infections and infestations leading to death e.g. pneumonia and peritonitis.\n\nPrecaution:  	Bone marrow suppression during therapy. Monitor cardiac function if conduction abnormalities result. Premedicaton (with corticosteroid, antihistamine and histamine H2-receptor antagonist) may be required to reduce risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue, if severe reactions e.g. hypotension, dyspnoea, angioedema or urticaria occur. Caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor for reactions of admin. Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients have not been established. Administer before platinum derivatives (cisplatin, carboplatin) if used in combination. Hazardous agent; use appropriate precautions for handling and disposal.\n\n\nMode of action: Myelosuppression was more profound when given after cisplatin than with the alternate sequence (e.g., paclitaxel before cisplatin).

The risk of hyperkalemia is relatively high in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) side effects have been reported from orally administered potassium chloride. They have included bad taste or aftertaste, nausea (10% to 30%), abdominal pain (20%), diarrhea (25%), dyspepsia or "heartburn" (5% to 20%) and GI ulceration. They have rarely included gastric or small bowel obstruction associated with the use of solid preparations.\n\nAll solid KCl preparations can cause erosive damage to the GI mucosa, especially when they are administered in high doses with an anticholinergic agent. Anticholinergic agents increase GI transit (and potassium-mucosa contact) time.\n\nPatients at higher risk of GI lesions include the elderly, the immobile and those with scleroderma, diabetes mellitus, mitral valve replacement, cardiomegaly or esophageal stricture. \n\nNearly half of all patients complain of a bad taste or aftertaste.\n\nLiquid KCl may be a better choice for patients with a history of esophageal stenosis or left atrial enlargement.\n\nHypersensitivity\n\nHypersensitivity side effects have been reported rarely. They have included a single case of contact dermatitis.\nDermatologic\n\nDermatologic side effects have rarely included skin rash.\n\nPrecaution: Potassium chloride (KCl) is contraindicated in the presence of hyperkalemia; renal failure and conditions in which potassium retention is present, including the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (such as triamterene, amiloride, or spironolactone); oliguria or azotemia; anuria; crush syndrome; severe hemolytic reactions; adrenocortical insufficiency (untreated Addison's disease); adynamical episodica hereditaria; acute dehydration; heat cramps; and early postoperative oliguria except during gastrointestinal drainage.\n\nPatients should not use potassium-rich salt substitutes without the advice of their healthcare professional during KCl therapy.\n\nIn patients with renal insufficiency, use of potassium chloride may cause potassium intoxication and life-threatening hyperkalemia.\n\nSolid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride can produce ulcerative and/or stenotic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. Potassium chloride should be discontinued immediately and the possibility of ulceration, obstruction, or perforation should be considered if severe vomiting, abdominal pain, distention, or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs.\n\nClinical evaluation and periodic laboratory evaluations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the administration of additional electrolyte supplements, or the administration of electrolyte-free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added.\n\nCertain potassium chloride extended-release tablets contain a wax matrix. This matrix is not absorbed and is excreted in the feces. In some instances the empty matrices may be noticeable in the stool.\n\nDose selection in the elderly should be cautious and should start at the lower end of the dosing range.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

Proparacaine Hydrochloride 0.5%	\n\n\tAristopharma\tProcain Eye Drops   10ml bot 150\n\tPopular\tP-caine Eye Drops 0.5% 10 ml plastic dropper bottle \n\tIndication: Corneal anesthesia, Foreign Bodies & Suture Removal\n\nDose: Deep anesthesia as in cataract extraction:\n\nInstill 1 drop every 5 to 10 minutes for 5 to 7 doses.\n\nRemoval of sutures:\n\nInstill 1 or 2 drops 2 or 3 minutes before removal of stitches.\n\nRemoval of foreign bodies:\n\nInstill 1 or 2 drops prior to operating.\n\nTonometry:\n\nInstill 1 or 2 drops immediately before measurement.\n\n\nContra-indication: This preparation is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the solution. This product should never be prescribed for the patient's own use.\n\nSide effects: Pupillary dilatation or cycloplegic effects have rarely been observed with proparacaine hydrochloride. The drug appears to be safe for use in patients sensitive to other local anesthetics, but local or systemic sensitivity occasionally occurs. Instillation of proparacaine in the eye at recommended concentration and dosage usually produces little or no initial irritation, stinging, burning, conjunctival redness, lacrimation or increased winking. However, some local irritation and stinging may occur several hours after the instillation. Rarely, a severe immediate-type, apparently hyperallergic corneal reaction may occur which includes acute, intense and diffuse epithelial keratitis; a gray, ground-glass appearance; sloughing of large areas of necrotic epithelium; corneal filaments and, sometimes, iritis with descemetitis. Allergic contact dermatitis with drying and fissuring of the fingertips has been reported. Softening and erosion of the corneal epithelium and conjunctival congestion and hemorrhage have been reported.\n\nPrecaution: Proparacaine hydrochloride should be used cautiously and sparingly in patients with known allergies, cardiac disease, or hyperthyroidism. The long-term toxicity of proparacaine is unknown, prolonged use may possibly delay wound healing. Although exceedingly rare with ophthalmic application of local anesthetics, it should be borne in mind that systemic toxicity (manifested by central nervous system stimulation followed by depression) may occur. Protection of the eye from irritating chemicals, foreign bodies and rubbing during the period of anesthesia is very important.

There is no reliable information showing how likely people with seafood allergy are to have an allergic reaction to fish oil; however, until more is known advise patients allergic to seafood to avoid or use fish oil supplements cautiously.\n\nBipolar disorder: Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition.\n\nDepression: Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition.\n\nDiabetes: There is some concern that taking high doses of fish oil might make the control of blood sugar more difficult.\n\nHigh blood pressure: Fish oil can lower blood pressure and might cause blood pressure to drop too low in people who are being treated with blood pressure-lowering medications.\n\nHIV/AIDS and other conditions in which the immune system response is lowered: Higher doses of fish oil can lower the body’s immune system response. This could be a problem for people whose immune system is already weak.\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis: There is some concern that fish oil might further increase the risk of getting cancer in people with this condition.\n\nPrecaution: Liver disease: Fish oil might increase the risk of bleeding.\n\nMode of action: \n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

Sodium Fusidate	\n\n\tIndication: Treatment of infections caused by susceptible organisms, especially staphylococci eg, osteomyelitis, septicaemia, endocarditis, superinfected cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, Acne vulgaris, skin and soft tissue infections, surgical and traumatic wound infections.\n\nDose: Topical/Cutaneous\nSkin infections\nAdult: As a 2% ointment/cream/gel: Apply onto affected area 3-4 times daily until there is improvement. If gauze dressing is used, then frequency of application may be reduced to 1-2 times daily.\nChild: As a 2% ointment/cream/gel: Apply onto affected area 3-4 times daily until there is improvement. If gauze dressing is used, then frequency of application may be reduced to 1-2 times daily.\n\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity to fusidic acid.\n\nSide effects: Fucidin given orally may cause gastrointestinal disturbances (dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting) which can normally be avoided by giving Fucidin with meals. Reversible increase of transaminases is reported at daily dosages of 1.5-3 g of Fucidin tablets. Reversible jaundice has been reported in some patients after administration of systemic Fucidin, most frequently in patients receiving IV Fucidin in high dosage and especially in serious Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. In some cases, instituting oral therapy may be beneficial. If the jaundice persists, Fucidin should be withdrawn, after which the serum bilirubin will return to normal. Allergic reactions are reported in very few cases.\n\nPrecaution: As fusidic acid is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through the bile, periodic liver function tests should be carried out in patients with liver dysfunction, abnormalities in the biliary pathway, when fusidic acid is given in high doses for prolonged periods, or when it is given in combination with other antibiotics which have similar excretion pathways eg, lincomycin and rifampicin. In vitro, fusidic acid displaces bilirubin from its albumin-binding site. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain and kernicterus has not been observed in neonates receiving systemic Fucidin. However, this observation should be borne in mind when fusidic acid is given to preterm, jaundiced, acidotic or seriously ill neonates.\nUse in pregnancy & lactation: Animal studies and many years of clinical experience have suggested that Fucidin is devoid of teratogenic effects. Fusidic acid passes the placenta and should be avoided during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy due to the theoretical risk of kernicterus.\nConcentrations of fusidic acid found in breast milk are negligible and its use is not contraindicated in nursing mothers.\n\nMode of action: Synergistic action with antistaphylococcal penicillin. Antagonism with ciprofloxacin.\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction: Synergistic action with antistaphylococcal penicillin. Antagonism with ciprofloxacin.

Initial dose may be estimated by streptokinase resistance test. Monitor treatment by maintaining thrombin clotting time at 2-4 times normal values.\n\n\n\nContra-indication: Severe hypertension, recent stroke, cerebral neoplasm, recent history of peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, coagulation defects also due to liver or kidney disease, recent surgery, childbirth. Hypersensitivity, increased risk of cerebral bleeding, trauma. Pregnancy. Active internal bleeding, bleeding GI lesions. Arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm; recent (within 10 days) facial or head trauma, intracranial or intraspinal surgery, More than 5 days and less than 12 months since previous Streptokinase therapy.\n\nSide effects: Headache and back pain, muscle pain (including myalgia), chills and/or fever as well as asthenia/malaise. Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleedings (including aggravation of menstrual bleeding), epistaxis. Development of antistreptokinase antibodies.

Allergic reactions, liver enzyme abnormalities, hypotension. Potentially Fatal: Haemorrhage; anaphylactic shock.\n\nPrecaution: Mitral stenosis associated with AF. Streptokinase treatment within last 12 mth, use after prolonged or traumatic CPR; diabetic retinopathy. Elderly. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, due to antistreptokinase antibodies, retreatment with Streptokinase or Streptokinase-containing products may not be effective if administered between five days and twelve months of prior Streptokinase administration or Streptococcal infections, such as Streptococcal pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis secondary to a Streptococcal infection. In principle, no thrombolytic treatment should be commenced before the 10th postoperative day. However, in cases of pulmonary embolism, the indication for earlier treatment may be very strong and after careful consideration of all the risks, Streptokinase may be given before the tenth postoperative day. The danger of bleeding from the operative area must, of course, be taken into account. The danger of haemorrhage is increased by simultaneous or previous treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., Heparin) or substances which inhibit platelet formation or function. If the patient is under active heparinisation, it should be neutralised by the administration of protamine sulphate before the start of thrombolytic therapy.  Repeated Administration After administration of Streptokinase, the titre of antistreptokinase antibodies begins to rise after approximately one week, reaching a peak at 2 to 3 weeks and remains elevated for 8 to 12 months. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, Streptokinase may not be effective if given during this period.\n\nMode of action: Antagonistic effects with antifibrinolytic agents e.g. aminocaproic acid.\nPotentially Fatal: Anticoagulants, heparin, antiplatelet agents e.g. aspirin and dipyridamole affect platelet function increasing the risk of haemorrhage.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Antagonistic effects with antifibrinolytic agents e.g. aminocaproic acid.\nPotentially Fatal: Anticoagulants, heparin, antiplatelet agents e.g. aspirin and dipyridamole affect platelet function increasing the risk of haemorrhage.

Severe hepatic impairment: Avoid.\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity to sulfonamide, severe hepatic impairment, lactation.\n\nSide effects: The following adverse reactions have been reported during the use of Tamsulosin: dizziness, abnormal ejaculation, and less frequently (1-2%) headache, asthenia, postural hypotension, palpitations and rhinitis. Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation can occasionally occur. Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, and urticaria can occur occasionally. As with other alpha-blockers, drowsiness, blurred vision, dry mouth or oedema can occur. Syncope has been reported rarely, and there have been very rare reports of angioedema and priapism.\n\nPrecaution: Hypersensitivity to Tamsulosin Hydrochloride. A history of orthostatic hypotension; severe hepatic insufficiency. As with other alpha1 blockers, a reduction in blood pressure can occur in individual cases during treatment with Tamsulosin, as a result of which, rarely, syncope can occur. At the first signs of orthostatic hypotension (dizziness, weakness) the patient should sit or lie down until the symptoms have disappeared. And they should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result (like driving, operating machinery or performing hazardous tasks). Before therapy with Tamsulosin is initiated the patient should be examined in order to exclude the presence of other conditions which can cause the same symptoms as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Digital rectal examination and when necessary determination of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) should be performed before treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. The treatment of severely renal impaired patients (creatinine clearance is less than10ml/min) should be approached with caution as these patients have not been studied. Caution should be exercised in porphyria or allergic reaction to this or any other medicine.\n\nMode of action: Increased plasma concentration w/ strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole). Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin), strong (e.g. paroxetine) or moderate (e.g. terbinafine) CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase exposure of tamsulosin. Increased plasma concentration w/ cimetidine. Additive effect w/ other ?-adrenergic blocking agents. Concomitant use w/ PDE5 inhibitors may lead to symptomatic hypotension. Decreased plasma concentration w/ furosemide.\n\nPregnancy category: B\n\nInteraction: Increased plasma concentration w/ strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole). Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin), strong (e.g. paroxetine) or moderate (e.g. terbinafine) CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase exposure of tamsulosin.

Rapid anti-coagulation: Initially, 10 mg daily for 2 days. Adjust subsequent doses based on PT/INR. Usual maintenance dose: 2-10 mg daily.\nElderly: Lower initial dose.\nHepatic impairment: Severe: Avoid.\n\n\n\nContra-indication: 1. Actual or potential haemorrhagic conditions, eg. Peptic ulcer, or to patients with uncontrolled hypertension\n2. Severe hepatic or renal disease\n3. Pregnancy\n4. Known hypersensitivity to warfarin\n5. Bacterial endocarditis\nIts use within 24 hours following surgery or labour should be undertaken with caution, if at all.\n\nSide effects: Hemorrhage is the principal adverse effect of oral anticoagulants. Other adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersensitivity, rash, alopecia, and unexplained drop in haematocrit, "purple toes", skin necrosis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction.\n\nPrecaution: Periodic determination of prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or other suitable coagulation test is essential. Numerous factors, alone or in combination, including travel, changes in diet, environment, physical state and medication may influence response of the patient to anticoagulants. It is generally good practice to monitor the patient's response with additional PT/INR determination in the period immediately after discharge from the hospital, and whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued or taken irregularly. \n\nThe following factors may exaggerate the effects of warfarin and necessitate a reduction in dosage; loss of weight, elderly subject, acute illness, deficient renal function, decreased dietary intake of vitamin K, administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Factors which may call for an increase in maintenance dosage include weight gain, diarrhea and vomiting, increased intake of vitamin K, fats and oils, and the administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Careful additional laboratory control is necessary if the patient is to be changed from one formulation to another. Reversal of warfarin anticoagulation by vitamin K takes several days. In emergency situations fresh frozen plasma should be given.\n\nMode of action: Cholestatic hepatitis may occur when taken concomitantly w/ ticlopidine. Increased risk of bleeding w/ other anticoagulants (e.g. argatroban, dabigatran, heparin), antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel), NSAIDs (e.g. celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine).

Thromboembolic events have also been observed in patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII for the treatment of VWD . Reports of thromboembolic events in VWD patients with other thrombotic risk factors receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy have been obtained from spontaneous reports, published literature, and a European clinical study. In some cases, inhibitors to coagulation factors may occur. However, no inhibitor formation was observed in any of the clinical studies.\n\nIn patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII in clinical studies for treatment of VWD, the most commonly reported adverse reactions observed by >5% of subjects are allergic-anaphylactic reactions (including urticaria, chest tightness, rash, pruritus, and edema). For patients undergoing surgery, the most common adverse reactions are postoperative wound and injection-site bleeding, and epistaxis.\n\nPrecaution: 5.1 Thromboembolic Events (VWD Patients)\n\nThromboembolic events have been reported in VWD patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor/von Willebrand Factor Complex replacement therapy, especially in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis.3,4 Early reports indicate a higher incidence may occur in females. Endogenous high levels of FVIII have also been associated with thrombosis, but no causal relationship has been established. Exercise caution and consider antithrombotic measures in all at-risk VWD patients who are receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy.\n\n5.2 Monitoring for Intravascular Hemolysis\n\nThis contains blood group isoagglutinins (anti-A and anti-B). When doses are very large or need to be repeated frequently (for example, when inhibitors are present or when pre- and post-surgical care is involved), monitor patients of blood groups A, B, and AB for signs of intravascular hemolysis and decreasing hematocrit values and treat appropriately.\n\n5.3 Monitoring VWF:RCo and FVIII Levels\n\nMonitor the VWF: RCo and FVIII levels of VWD patients receiving this medicine using standard coagulation tests, especially in cases of surgery. It is advisable to monitor trough VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels at least once a day in order to adjust the dosage of this as needed to avoid excessive accumulation of coagulation factors \n\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

Dose to be given via intradermal inj. \n\nIntravesical\nImmunotherapy of bladder cancer\nDosage: The content of 1 vial is required for 1 bladder instillation.\nDuration: A standard treatment schedule consists of 1 intravesical instillation of BCG-Medac per week for 6 consecutive weeks as induction therapy. BCG treatment must not start until 2-3 weeks after transurethral resection (TUR). After a treatment-free interval of 4 weeks, intravesical administration should continue using maintenance therapy for at least 1 year. \n\nInduction Therapy (Prophylactic Treatment of Recurrence): BCG therapy should begin about 2-3 weeks after TUR or bladder biopsy, and without traumatic catheterisation, and be repeated at weekly intervals for 6 weeks. In intermediate and high-risk tumours, this should be followed by maintenance therapy.\n\nMaintenance Therapy: One schedule consists of a 12-month therapy with treatments at monthly intervals. Another maintenance scheme consists of 3 instillations at weekly intervals at month 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36. In this scheme, a total of 27 instillations are administered during a period of 3 years.\n\nAdministration: BCG-Medac should be administered in the conditions required for intravesical endoscopy.  The bladder must be emptied before BCG instillation. BCG-Medac is introduced into the bladder by means of a catheter and at low pressure. \n\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of BCG-Medac.\nBCG-Medac should not be used in immunosuppressed patients or persons with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, whether due to concurrent disease (eg, positive HIV serology, leukaemia, lymphoma), cancer therapy (eg, cytostatic drugs, radiation) or immunosuppressive therapy (eg, corticosteroids).\nBCG-Medac should not be administered to persons with active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis should be ruled out in individuals by anamnesis.\nPast history of radiotherapy of the bladder.\nBCG-Medac must not be instilled before 2-3 weeks after a TUR, a bladder biopsy or a traumatic catheterisation. Perforation of the bladder. Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) (see Precautions).\nUse in lactation: There are no adequate data from the excretion of these bacteria in breastmilk. This treatment is contraindicated in nursing women.\n\nSide effects: Side effects of BCG treatment are frequent but generally mild and transient. Adverse reactions usually increase with the number of BCG instillations.\nIn uncommon cases of arthritis/arthralgias, skin rash may occur. In most cases of arthritis, arthralgias and skin rash, these can be attributed to hypersensitivity reactions of the patient to BCG. It may be necessary in some cases to discontinue the administration of BCG-Medac.\nLocal Adverse Reactions: Discomfort and pain when urinating and frequent urination occur in up to 90% of the patients. The cystitis and inflammatory reaction (granulomata) may be an essential part of the antitumour activity.\nFurther local side effects which are uncommonly observed: Macroscopic haematuria, UTI, bladder retraction, urinary obstruction, bladder contracture, symptomatic granulomatous prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis. Renal abscess is rarely observed. Furthermore, genital disorders (eg, vaginal pain, dyspareunia) may occur with an unknown frequency.\nTransient Systemic BCG Reaction: Low grade fever, flu-like symptoms and general discomfort may occur. These symptoms usually subside within 24-48 hrs and should be managed by standard symptomatic treatment. These reactions are signs of a starting immune reaction. All patients receiving BCG-Medac should be carefully monitored and advised to report all incidences of fever and other events outside the urinary tract.\nSevere Systemic Adverse Reactions/Infections: Systemic adverse reactions/infections are defined as: Fever >39.5°C during at least 12 hrs, fever >38.5°C during at least 48 hrs, miliary pneumonia due to BCG, granulomatous hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, organic dysfunction (other than genitourinary tract) with granulomatous inflammation at biopsy, Reiter's syndrome. Severe systemic BCG reaction/infection can lead to BCG sepsis which is a life-threatening situation.\n\nPrecaution: BCG-Medac may not be used for SC, intradermal, IM or IV administration or vaccination.\nTreatment of Symptoms, Signs or Syndrome: See Adverse Reactions.\nNumber of BCG instillations: Side effects of BCG-treatment are frequent but generally mild and transient. Adverse reactions usually increase with the number of BCG instillations.\nSevere Systemic BCG Infection/Reaction: Systemic BCG infections/reactions have been rarely reported and are described as fever >39.5°C during at least 12 hrs, fever >38.5°C during at least 48 hrs, miliary pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, organic dysfunction (other than genitourinary tract) with granulomatous inflammation at biopsy. Reiter's syndrome. The possibility of severe systemic BCG infections has to be considered before starting the therapy.\n\nMode of action: Concurrent use with antimicrobials may interfere with efficacy of intravesicular BCG and suppress the immune response to BCG vaccination. Immune globulins may reduce the therapeutic effect of live organism vaccines. Increased risk of infections associated with vaccines (live organism) when used with immunosuppressants. Immune response of BCG vaccination may be compromised when used within 30 days of another live organism vaccine.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Concurrent use with antimicrobials may interfere with efficacy of intravesicular BCG and suppress the immune response to BCG vaccination. Immune globulins may reduce the therapeutic effect of live organism vaccines. Increased risk of infections associated with vaccines (live organism) when used with immunosuppressants. Immune response of BCG vaccination may be compromised when used within 30 days of another live organism vaccine.

Periodic monitoring of renal function tests and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential risk for developing acute renal failure.  Increases in serum creatinine and BUN have been observed as soon as one to two days following treatment with other IGIV products.\n    During administration, monitor the patient's vital signs continuously and observe the patient carefully for any associated symptoms.\n    DO NOT EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED INFUSION RATE of 1 mL/kg/hour (50 mg/kg/h), and follow the infusion schedule closely  . If a patient develops an infusion reaction, slow the rate of infusion immediately or temporarily interrupt the infusion.\n\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: 
Coagulation Factor IX Human USP	\n\n\tIndication: Hemophilia B or Christmas disease\n\nDose: In adult PTPs, on average, one international unit of coagulation factor ix recombinant per kilogram of body weight increased the circulating activity of factor IX by 0.8 ± 0.2 (range 0.4 to 1.4) IU/dL. \n\nIn pediatric patients, on average, one international unit of coagulation factor ix recombinant per kilogram of body weight increased the circulating activity of factor IX by 0.7 ± 0.3 (range 0.2 to 2.1 IU/dL; median of 0.6 IU/dL per IU/kg). \n\nContra-indication:  patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to hamster protein.\n\nSide effects:     fever or chills;\n    continued bleeding after treatment;\n    feeling like you might pass out;\n    sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body;\n    sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; or\n    swelling in your feet or ankles, weight gain, loss of appetite.\n\nLess serious side effects may be more likely to occur, such as:\n\n    headache;\n    warmth, redness, or tingly feeling under your skin;\n    nausea, vomiting;\n    dizziness; or\n    pain, redness, or swelling where the medicine was injected.\n\nPrecaution: Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) have been detected in patients receiving factor IXcontaining products. As with all factor IX products, patients using  (coagulation factor ix recombinant) should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors . Patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis upon subsequent challenge with factor IX.\n\n Patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of inhibitor. Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions. \n\nPatients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product. In view of the potential for allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial (approximately 10 - 20) administrations of factor IX should be performed under medical supervision where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

Dextrose Hydrous + Sodium Chloride + Sodium Lactate + Calcium chloride + Magnesium chloride (Peritoneal dialysis solution)	\n\n\tIndication: Acute renal failure, Chronic renal failure. Peritoneal dialysis,\n\nDose:  Solutions are provided for intraperitoneal administration only. The mode of therapy, frequency of treatment, formulation, exchange volume, duration of dwell, and length of dialysis should be selected by the physician responsible for the treatment of the individual patient.\n\nIn case of IPD: Usually  2 litres of peritoneal dialysis solutiion is instill into the abdominal cavity and dwell over a period of an hour then drained from the cavity. Exchange should be continued for 8-36 hours.\n\nTo avoid the risk of severe dehydration or hypovolemia and to minimize the loss of protein, it is advisable to select the peritoneal dialysis solution with lowest level of osmolarity consistent with the fluid removal requirements for that exchange.\n\nContra-indication: Patient with excessive obesity and pregnancy.\n\nSide effects: Adverse reactions occurring with administration of peritoneal dialysis include mechanical and solution related problems as well as the results of contamination of equipment or improper technique in catheter placement. Abdominal pain, bleeding, peritonitis, subcutaneous infection around a peritoneal catheter, catheter blockage, difficulty in fluid removal, and ileus are among the complications of the procedure. Solution related adverse reactions may include peritonitis, catheter site infection, electrolyte and fluid imbalances, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, hypertension, hypotension, disequilibrium syndrome and muscle cramping.\n\nIf an adverse reaction does occur, institute appropriate therapeutic procedures according to the patient's needs and conditions, and save the remainder of the fluid in the bag for evaluation if deemed necessary.\n\nPrecaution: Solution should not be administered unless it is clear, all seals are intact, and there is no evidence of leaking.\n\nCare should be taken to see that the catheter is inserted completely, since leakage around the catheter, if not controlled, can create edema from subcutaneous infiltration of the dialysis solution. This will also create an inaccurate fluid balance measurement.\n\nChronic patients that have been stabilized on peritoneal dialysis therapy should have routine evaluation of electrolyte blood chemistries and hematologic factors measured in order to determine the patient's ongoing condition.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

Human 1gG Proteins with Rabies	\n\n\tIndication: Postexposure prophylaxis of Rabies\n\nDose: Recommended Dose: Adults and Children: 40 IU/kg of body weight. However, for children, particularly in the case of multiple wounds, it has been proposed to dilute the dose 2-3 times in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution to obtain a sufficient quantity of equine rabies immune globulin to infiltrate the wound(s) correctly.\n\nIt must be injected slowly by the IM route.\nIf anatomically feasible, as much as possible of the dose should be infiltrated around and into the wounds. The remainder of the dose should be administered IM (into the gluteal region) in a single injection.\n\nAs a general rule, 1 IU of Factor IX activity per kg can be expected to increase the circulating level of Factor IX by 1% [IU/dL] of normal.\n\nContra-indication: Known history of allergic symptoms to horse proteins.\n\nSide effects: Do not administer the vaccine IV due to the risk of shock ie, sudden collapse with drop in blood pressure. \n\nPrecaution: Administered intravenously at a rate that will permit observation of the patient for any immediate reaction. Rates of infusion of up to 225 IU per minute have been regularly tolerated with no adverse reactions. If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration   , the rate of infusion should be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient. The infusion should be stopped promptly and appropriate countermeasures and supportive therapy should be administered should evidence of an acute hypersensitivity reaction be observed.

Tetanus (Human Anti-tetanus) Immunoglobulin	\n\n\tCSL Behring GmbH, Germany\tTetagam(R) P Injection 250IU 250 IU prefilled syringe  1023\n\tCSL Behring GmbH, Germany\tHuman Anti-tetanus Immuno Globulin Injection 250 IU  1200\n\tIndication: Passive immunisation against Tetanus\n\nDose: Adults and children 7 years and older: 250 units(1 ml) should be given by deep intramuscular injection . \nAt the same time, but in a different extremity and with a separate syringe, active immunization with adsorved tetanus vaccine should be administered. \n\nChildren less than 7 years old: In small children the routine prophylactic dose  may be calculated by the body weight (4.0 units/kg). \n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity homologous Ig-containing medicinal products particularly in patients w/ IgA deficiency & concurrent presence of Ab to IgA.\n\nSide effects: Slight soreness at the site of injection and slight temperature elevation may be noted at times. Sensitization to repeated injections of human immunoglobulin is extremely rare.\n\nIn the course of routine injections of large numbers of persons with immunoglobulin there have been a few isolated occurrences of angioneurotic edema, nephrotic syndrome, and anaphylactic shock after injection.\n\nPrecaution: Intravenous injection of immunoglobulin intended for intramuscular use can, on occasion, cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure, and a picture not unlike anaphylaxis. Injections should only be made intramuscularly and care should be taken to draw back on the plunger of the syringe before injection in order to be certain that the needle is not in a blood vessel. Intramuscular injections are preferably administered in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal region should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.\n\nChemoprophylaxis against tetanus is neither practical nor useful in managing wounds. Wound cleaning, debridement when indicated, and proper immunization are important. The need for tetanus toxoid (active immunization), with or without TIG (passive immunization), depends on both the condition of the wound and the patient’s vaccination history. Rarely has tetanus occurred among persons with documentation of having received a primary series of toxoid injections.\n\nMode of action: May reduce the efficacy of live vaccines.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: May reduce the efficacy of live vaccines.

In clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such circumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same vaccination visit.\n\nContra-indication: Subjects with history of intussusception. Subjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a contraindication for immunisation.\n\nSide effects: Risk of intussusception has not been established. The overall incidence of intussusception remains rare.\n\nPrecaution: It is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. Parents/guardians should be advised to seek medical advice promptly where these signs/symptoms are evident. There is a potential risk for transmission to non-vaccinated contacts. It should be administered with caution to infants with close contacts who are immunodeficient, such as household members with malignancies or who are otherwise immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Contacts of recent vaccinees should be advised to observe personal hygiene (e.g. washing their hands when changing childrenâ€™s nappies).\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

Interferon Beta 1a	\n\n\tIndication: Relapsing multiple sclerosis\n\nDose: Dosages   shown to be safe and effective are 22 mcg and 44 mcg injected subcutaneously three times per week. if possible, at the same time (preferably in the late afternoon or evening) on the same three days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) at least 48 hours apart each week . Generally, patients should be started at 20% of the prescribed dose three times per week and increased over a 4-week period to the targeted dose, either 22 mcg three times per week   or 44 mcg three times per week  . Patients prescribed a targeted dose of 22 mcg three times per week should use the pre-filled syringes for titration. Following the administration of each dose, any residual product remaining in the syringe should be discarded in a safe and proper manner.\n\nContra-indication: Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon, human albumin, or any other component of the formulation.\n\nSide effects: The most commonly reported adverse reactions were injection site disorders, influenza-like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, rigors, chest pain, back pain, myalgia), abdominal pain, depression, elevation of liver enzymes and hematologic abnormalities. The most frequently reported adverse reactions resulting in clinical intervention   were injection site disorders, influenza-like symptoms, depression and elevation of liver enzymes\n\nPrecaution: Caution should be exercised when administering  to patients with pre-existing seizure disorders. Seizures have been associated with the use of beta interferons. Leukopenia and new or worsening thyroid abnormalities have developed in some patients treated . Regular monitoring for these conditions is recommended\n\nMode of action: Drugs w/ narrow therapeutic index eg antiepileptics & some classes of antidepressants.\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction: Drugs w/ narrow therapeutic index eg antiepileptics & some classes of antidepressants.
Ioversol	\n\n\tIndication: Peripheral and coronary arteriography and left ventriculography,Intravenous excretory urography,Angiography\n\nDose: As with all radiopaque contrast agents, only the lowest dose necessary to obtain adequate visualization should be used. A lower dose may reduce the possibility of an adverse reaction. Most procedures do not require use of either the maximum volume or the highest concentration . The combination of volume and concentration  to be used should be carefully individualized accounting for factors such as age, body weight, size of the vessel and the rate of blood flow within the vessel. Other factors such as anticipated pathology, degree and extent of opacification required, structure(s) or area to be examined, disease processes affecting the patient, and equipment and technique to be employed should be considered.\n\nIt is desirable that intravascularly administered iodinated contrast agents be at or close to body temperature when injected.\n\nIf during administration a reaction occurs, the injection should be stopped until the reaction has subsided.\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity.\n\nSide effects: Usually mild to moderate, of short duration and resolve spontaneously (without treatment). However, serious, life-threatening and fatal reactions, mostly of cardiovascular origin, have been associated with the administration of iodine-containing contrast media.\n\nInjections of contrast media are often associated with sensations of warmth and pain. In controlled double-blind clinical studies, significantly less warmth and pain were associated with the injection   than with iothalamate meglumine, diatrizoate meglumine, and diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium.\n\nPrecaution: Diagnostic procedures which involve the use of iodinated intravascular contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel skilled and experienced in the particular procedure to be performed. A fully equipped emergency cart, or equivalent supplies and equipment, and personnel competent in recognizing and treating adverse reactions of all types should always be available. Since severe delayed reactions have been known to occur, emergency facilities and competent personnel should be available for at least 30 to 60 minutes after administration.\n\nMode of action: \n\nPregnancy category: B\n\nInteraction:

Liraglutide	\n\n\tNovo Nordisk\tVictoza Injection 3ml 1's  pack 7850\n\tIndication: Type 2 diabetes\n\nDose: It can be administered once daily at any time of day, independently of meals, and can be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment.\n\nFor all patients  should be initiated with a dose of 0.6 mg per day for one week. The 0.6 mg dose is a starting dose intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms during initial titration, and is not effective for glycemic control. After one week at 0.6 mg per day, the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. If the 1.2 mg dose does not result in acceptable glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg.\n\nWhen initiating , consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia\n\nContra-indication: Do not use in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).\n\nDo not use in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to   any of the product components.\n\nSide effects: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nPrecaution: In the clinical trials, there have been 6 reported cases of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia among Victoza-treated patients and 2 cases in comparator-treated patients (1.3 vs. 1.0 cases per 1000 patient-years). One comparator-treated patient with MTC had pre-treatment serum calcitonin concentrations >1000 ng/L suggesting pre-existing disease. All of these cases were diagnosed after thyroidectomy, which was prompted by abnormal results on routine, protocol-specified measurements of serum calcitonin. Five of the six Victoza-treated patients had elevated calcitonin concentrations at baseline and throughout the trial. One Victoza and one non-Victoza-treated patient developed elevated calcitonin concentrations while on treatment. \n\nMode of action: Oral Contraceptives: Liraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. Tmax was delayed by 1.5 hrs with liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of either ethinyloestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide.\n\nWarfarin: No interaction study has been performed. Upon initiation of Liraglutide treatment in patients on warfarin more frequent monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) is recommended.\n\nInsulin: Combination of Liraglutide with insulin has not been evaluated.\n\nIncompatibilities: Substances added to Liraglutide may cause degradation of liraglutide. In the absence of compatibility studies, Liraglutide must not be mixed with other medicinal products.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Oral Contraceptives: Liraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product.

Menotrophin 75 IU FSH + 75 IU LH	\n\n\tIndication: Infertility, Assisted reproductive technologies, Polycystic ovarian disease, In vitro fertilisation procedures\n\nDose: Unless prescribed otherwise, doses are as follows: Sterility in Females: The dosage of HMG for the induction of follicle growth in normo- or hypogonadotrophic women varies according to the individual. The amount depends on ovarian reaction and should be checked by ultrasound examinations of the ovaries and measuring estradiol levels. If the HMG dosage is too high for the treated individual, multiple uni- and bilateral follicle growth can occur. HMG is administered IM or SC and in general, the therapy is begun with a daily dosage corresponding to 75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH daily. If the ovaries do not respond, the dosage can slowly be increased until a rise in estradiol secretion and follicle growth is evident. Treatment with the same dosage of HMG continues until the preovulatory estradiol serum level is attained. If the level rises too quickly, the dosage should be reduced. To induce ovulation, hCG 5000 or 10,000 IU are injected IM 1-2 days after the last HMG administration. Note: After administering a HMG dosage which is too high for the corresponding individual, a subsequent hCG administration can cause an unintentional hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Sterility in Males: Initially, 3 x 1000 and 3000 IU hCG a week are administered until a normal testosterone serum level is reached. Then, an additional dose of HMG 3 x (75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH)/week is administered IM for a few months.\n\nContra-indication: Females: Pregnancy, enlargement of the ovaries or cysts that is not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome, gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause and tumors in the uterus, ovaries and breasts.\nMales: Carcinoma of the prostate and tumors in the testes.\nThe following conditions must be properly treated before therapy with HMG is begun: Dysfunctions of the thyroid gland and of the cortex of the suprarenal gland, a rise in the serum level of prolactin with different causes (hyperprolactinaemia), tumors in the pituitary gland (hypophysis) or in part of the diencephalon (hypothalamus).\n\nSide effects: Occasionally, nausea and vomiting can occur.\nIn single cases, hypersensitivity reactions and fever can occur during treatment with HMG. The administration of Menogon may lead to reactions at the injection site: Reddening, pain, swelling and itching. In very rare cases, long-term usage can lead to the formation of antibodies, making the therapy ineffective.\nTreatment with HMG can often lead to ovarian hyperstimulation that first becomes clinically relevant after the administration of hCG (pregnancy hormone) to induce ovulation. This can lead to the formation of large ovarian cysts that tend to rupture and to intra-abdominal bleeding.\nIn addition, the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal cavity (ascites), the accumulation of fluids in the chest cavity (hydrothorax), a decrease in the excretion of urine (oliguria), lowering of the blood pressure (hypotension), and occlusion of blood vessels by blood clots (thromboembolic phenomena) can occur. Treatment should be immediately discontinued when the first signs of hyperstimulation appear: Abdominal pain and a palpable (by the physician) enlargement in the lower abdomen, which can be detected sonographically.\nIf abdominal pain occurs, see the doctor.\nWith pregnancy, these side effects can intensify, continue over a long period of time, and be life threatening.\nUnintentional multiple pregnancies occur more often during treatment with HMG.\n\nPrecaution: hCG should not be administered to induce ovulation in females whose ovaries have unintentionally been hyperstimulated.\nWhen treating sterile women, ovarian activity should be checked (ultrasound and estradiol levels in serum response) prior to HMG administration. During treatment, these tests should be carried out every 1-2 days until stimulation occurs. Ovarian reaction can also be measured using a cervix index. Close supervision is imperative during treatment. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if unintentional hyperstimulation occurs.\nFurther remarks concerning the steps to be taken when ovarian hyperstimulation has occurred can be found under Actions.\n\nMode of action: Increased follicular response with clomiphene citrate. Higher dose of menotrophin needed when gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist is used for pituitary desensitisation.\n\nPregnancy category: X\n\nInteraction: Increased follicular response with clomiphene citrate. Higher dose of menotrophin needed when gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist is used for pituitary desensitisation.

Monobasic Sodium Phosphate + Diabasic Sodium Phosphate	\n\n\tIndication: Cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy, Foods and water treatment\n\nDose: The recommended dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing for adult patients is 32 tablets (48 grams of sodium phosphate) taken orally with a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids in the following manner: \n\nThe evening before the colonoscopy procedure: Take 4 monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets with 8 ounces of clear liquids every 15 minutes for a total of 20 tablets.                     \n\nOn the day of the colonoscopy procedure: Starting 3-5 hours before the procedure, take 4 monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets with 8 ounces of clear liquids every 15 minutes for a total of 12 tablets. \n\nPatients should be advised of the importance of taking the recommended fluid regimen. It is recommended that patients receiving monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets be advised to adequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets.  \n\nPatients should not use monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing within seven days of previous administration. No additional enema or laxative is required, and patients should be advised NOT to take additional agents, particularly those containing sodium phosphate\n\nContra-indication: Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with biopsy-proven acute phosphate nephropathy.\n\nMonobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to sodium phosphate salts or any of its ingredients.\n\nSide effects: Abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported with the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Dizziness and headache were reported less frequently. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, diarrhea was not defined as an adverse event in the clinical studies. Table 2 shows the most common adverse events associated with the use of 48 grams of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, 60 grams of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, and 60 grams of Visicol in the colon preparation trials (n=931).\n\nPrecaution: Patients should be instructed to drink 8 ounces of clear liquids with each 4-tablet dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Patients should take a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids with monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Inadequate fluid intake, as with any effective purgative, may lead to excessive fluid loss, hypovolemia, and dehydration. Dehydration from purgation may be exacerbated by inadequate oral fluid intake, vomiting, and/or use of diuretics.\n\nPatients should be instructed not to administer additional laxative or purgative agents, particularly additional sodium phosphate-based purgative or enema products.\n\nProlongation of the QT interval has been observed in some patients who were dosed with sodium phosphate colon preparations. QT prolongation with sodium phosphate tablets has been associated with electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, since serious complications may occur. Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients with known prolonged QT.\n\nAdministration of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets may induce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, since this endoscopic finding was observed with other sodium phosphate cathartic preparations. In the monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets clinical program, aphthous ulcers were observed in 3% of patients who took the 48 gram monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets dosing regimen. This colonoscopic finding should be considered in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nBecause published data suggest that sodium phosphate absorption may be enhanced in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in such patients.\n\nMode of action: \n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

People 2 years through 64 years of age who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease (e.g., those with sickle cell disease, HIV infection, or other immunocompromising conditions) should also receive PPSV23.\n\nPrimary Immunization: One 0.5 mL inj is sufficient to provide protection against the pneumococcal serotypes contained in the vaccine.\n\nRevaccination: One 0.5 mL inj must not be given within 5 years except in very high-risk subjects or patients under immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nAdministered intramuscularly or subcutaneously only.\n\n\n\nContra-indication: A known allergy to one of the components of the vaccine. Fever or acute disease or a relapse of a chronic disease: It is preferable to postpone vaccination. Vaccination is not recommended for subjects who have been vaccinated within the previous 3 years, unless indicated otherwise. A confirmed or suspected episode of pneumococcal infection is not a contraindication and vaccination should be considered according to the underlying risk status.\n\nSide effects: Local Reactions at the Injection Site: Pain, erythema (redness), induration and oedema (swelling). These reactions are mild and transient. Rare reactions eg, Arthus phenomenon (severe local reactions) are reversible without after-effects; they mainly occur in subjects with high initial levels of pneumococcal antibody. Moderate and transient hyperthermia (fever) sometimes >39°C which generally occurs very shortly after vaccination and resolves within 24 hrs.\nOther General Reactions: Adenopathy (inflammation of the lymph nodes), rashes, arthralgia (pain in the joints) and allergic reactions [urticaria, Quincke'soedema (type of urticaria with sudden swelling of the face and neck), anaphylactoid reactions (severe allergic reaction)], headache, muscle pain, malaise, and fatigue have exceptionally been reported.\n\nPrecaution:  Use in pregnancy: It should only be used during pregnancy on medical advice.\n\nMode of action: Reduce immune response to Zostavax.

Purified Soybean Oil	\n\n\tIndication: Parenteral fat emulsions, essential fatty acid deficiency, Parenteral nutrition.\n\nDose: 1g triglycerides corresponds to 10 ml Intralipid 10%.\n\nAdults. The recommended maximum dosage is 3 g triglycerides/kg body weight/day. Within this upper limit, Intralipid can be given to contribute up to 70% of the energy requirements, also in patients with highly increased energy requirements. The infusion rate for Intralipid 10% should not exceed 500 ml in 5 hours.\n\nNeonates and infants. The recommended dosage range in neonates and infants is 0.5-4 g triglycerides/ kg bw/day. The rate of infusion should not exceed 0.17 g triglycerides/kg bw/hour (4 g in 24 hours). In prematures and low birthweight neonates, Intralipid should preferably be infused continuously over 24 hours. The initial dosage should be 0.5-1 g/kg bw/day followed by a successive increase by 0.5-1 g/kg bw/day up to 2g/kg bw/day. Only with close monitoring of serum triglyceride concentration, liver tests and oxygen saturation may the dosage be increased to 4 g/kg bw/day. The rates given are maximum rates and no attempt should be made to exceed these in order to compensate for missed doses.\n\nContra-indication: Intralipid is contraindicated in patients with acute shock and in patients with severe hyperlipemia. Severe liver insufficiency. Hemophagocytotic syndrome. Hypersensitivity to egg-, soya- or peanut protein or to any of the active substances or excipients.\n\nSide effects: Intralipid infusion may cause a rise in body temperature and, less frequently, shivering, chills and nausea/vomiting (incidence<1%).\n\nPrecaution: Intralipid should be given with caution in conditions of impaired lipid metabolism as in renal insufficiency, uncompensated diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, impaired liver function, hypothyroidism (if hypertri-glyceridemic) and sepsis. If Intralipid is given to patients with these conditions, close monitoring of the serum triglyceride concentration is obligatory.\n\nThis medicinal product contains soya-bean oil and egg phospholipids, which may rarely cause allergic reactions. Cross allergic reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut.\n\nIntralipid should be given with caution to neonates and prematures with hyperbilirubinemia and cases with suspected pulmonary hypertension. In neonates, particularly prematures on long term parenteral nutrition, platelet count, liver tests and serum triglyceride concentration should be monitored.\n\nIntralipid may interfere with certain laboratory measurements (bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, oxygen saturation, Hb etc) if blood is sampled before fat has been adequately cleared from the blood stream. Fat is cleared after a fat free interval of 5-6 hours in most patients.\n\nMode of action: \n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

There is no need to start the series over again, regardless of the time elapsed between doses.\n\nRoutine booster injections: To maintain adequate protection, a booster dose of 0.5 ml of adsorbed tetanus vaccine every 10 years thereafter is recommended.\n\nVaccination of injured persons:\nClean and minor wound: \n•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, no need of additional vaccine.\n•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.\n\nAll other dirty wounds (contaminated with feces, soil, and saliva): \n•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.\n•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml along with tetanus immunoglobulin required.\n\nIf a person has no previous vaccination or uncertain, the primary series of 3 doses of 0.5ml adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be given along with tetanus immunoglobulin with 1st dose.\nProtection of neonatal tetanus\nFor prevention of neonatal tetanus, adsorbed tetanus vaccine is recommended for immunization of women of childbearing age.\n \nFor pregnant woman who have not had previous immunization, 2 doses of tetanus toxoid at four weeks interval preferably during the last two trimester or at least 2 weeks before delivery should be given during pregnancy so that protective antibody would be transferred to the infant in order to prevent neonatal tetanus. e.g. 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 6th month of pregnancy and 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 7th month of pregnancy.\n\nPregnant woman who have completed the course of tetanus, next 10 years no need of additional dose during pregnancy. Thereafter a single booster dose would be sufficient to extend immunity.\n\n\nContra-indication: It is a contraindication to use this or any other related vaccine after a serious adverse event temporally associated with a previous dose including an anaphylactic reaction. A history of systemic allergic or neurologic reactions following a previous dose of Tetanus Toxoid is an absolute contraindication for further use. \n\nIf a contraindication to using tetanus toxoid -containing preparations exists in a person who has not completed a primary immunizing course of tetanus toxoid and other than a clean, minor wound is sustained; only passive immunization should be given using TIG (Human). \n\nElective immunization should be deferred during the course of any febrile illness or acute infection. A minor afebrile illness such as a mild upper respiratory infection should not preclude immunization. Elective immunization procedures should be deferred during an outbreak of poliomyelitis. \n\n\nSide effects: Mild inj site reactions eg transient swelling, rash, fever, malaise, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, pruritus, dizziness.Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions. \n\nPrecaution: Do not administer IV. Use subcutaneous route in bleeding disorders. Withhold vaccination in moderate or severe febrile illness. Pregnancy, lactation, history of Guillian-Barre syndrome.\n\nMode of action: Decreased immunologic response with concurrent immunosuppressants. Neutralisation of tetanus immune globulin and tetanus toxoid adsorbed if not given at different sites using different syringes.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Decreased immunologic response with concurrent immunosuppressants. Neutralisation of tetanus immune globulin and tetanus toxoid adsorbed if not given at different sites using different syringes.

Recombinant Somatropin	\n\n\tIndication: Children's growth disorders, growth hormone deficiency,Turner syndrome, chronic renal failure, Prader-Willi syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation,  severe idiopathic short stature\n\nDose: Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)\n\nGenerally, a dosage of 0.16 to 0.24 mg/kg body weight /week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.\n\nPrader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)\n\nGenerally, a dosage of 0.24 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.\n\nSmall for Gestational Age (SGA)\n\nGenerally, a dosage of up to 0.48 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.\n\nIdiopathic Short Stature (ISS)\n\nGenerally, a dose up to 0.47 mg/kg of body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.\nDosing of Adult Patients\nAdult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)\n\nBased on the weight-based dosing utilized in clinical studies with another somatropin product, the recommended dosage at the start of therapy is not more than 0.04 mg/kg/week given as a daily subcutaneous injection. The dose may be increased at 4- to 8-week intervals according to individual patient requirements to not more than 0.08 mg/kg/week. Clinical response, side effects, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-I levels may be used as guidance in dose titration.\n\nAlternatively, taking into account recent literature, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15-0.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight. This dose can be increased gradually every 1-2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF-I concentrations. During therapy, the dose should be decreased if required by the occurrence of adverse events and/or serum IGF-I levels above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person.\n\nA lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men. Oral estrogen administration may increase the dose requirements in women.\n\nContra-indication:     Acute Critical Illness\n    Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome who are severely obese or have severe respiratory impairment—reports of sudden death\n    Active Malignancy\n    Active Proliferative or Severe Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy\n    Children with closed epiphyses\n    Known hypersensitivity to somatropin or excipients\n\n\nSide effects: Injection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy and headaches.\nSudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome with risk factors including severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea and unidentified respiratory infection\nIntracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in teenagers/young adults treated with radiation to the head as children for a first neoplasm and somatropin.\nGlucose intolerance including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well as overt diabetes mellitus.\nIntracranial hypertension.\nFluid retention manifested by edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias.\nPancreatitis.\n\nPrecaution:     Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk\n    Prader-Willi Syndrome in children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur\n    Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin–in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm\n    Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked.

Recombinent Human Luteinising Hormone (Lutropin alpha)	\n\n\tIndication: Female infertility,  (LH) and FSH deficiency\n\nDose: Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response. A recommended regimen commences at lutropinalpha 75 IU (ie, 1 vial of Luveris) daily with FSH 75-150 IU.\n\nIf an FSH, dose increase is deemed appropriate; dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any 1 cycle to up to 5 weeks.\n\nWhen an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5000-10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hrs after the last Luveris and FSH injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity to gonadotropins or to any of the excipients of Luveris.\nOvarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma; active, untreated tumors of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland; ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease; gynecological hemorrhages of unknown origin.\nUse in pregnancy & lactationThis should not be administered during pregnancy and lactation.\n\nSide effects: General Description: Lutropin alpha is used for the stimulation of follicular development in association with follitropin alpha. In this context, it is difficult to attribute adverse reactions to any one of the substances used.\nThere is considerable post-marketing safety experience with human luteinizing hormone (hLH)-containing medicinal products of urinary origin. The safety profile of Luveris is expected to be very similar to that of urine-derived hLH, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions and application site disorders.\nIn a clinical trial, mild and moderate injection site reactions (bruising, pain, redness, itching or swelling) were reported in 7.4% and 0.9% of the injections, respectively. No severe injection site reactions were reported. To date, no systemic allergic reactions have been reported following Luveris administration.\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome was observed in <6% of patients treated with Luveris. No severe OHSS was reported.\nEctopic pregnancy may also occur, especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.\n\nPrecaution: Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.\nIt should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained eg, ovarian failure, malformation of the sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy or fibroid tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.\nIn addition, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency and hyperprolactinemia and, pituitary or hypothalmic tumors, and appropriate specific treatment given.\nPatients undergoing follicular growth stimulation are at increased risk of developing hyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular development.\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome can become a serious medical event characterised by large ovarian cysts which are prone to rupture. Excessive ovarian response seldom gives rise to significant hyperstimulation unless hCG is administered to induce ovulation. It is therefore prudent to withhold hCG in such cases and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or use barrier methods for at least 4 days.\nCareful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound is recommended prior to and during stimulation therapy, especially in patients with polycystic ovaries.\nIn patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.\n\nMode of action: Luveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except follitropin ? for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.\n\nIncompatibilities: Luveris must not be mixed with other medicinal products except follitropin ?.\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction: Luveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except follitropin ? for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.\n\nIncompatibilities: Luveris must not be mixed with other medicinal products except follitropin ?.

Sodium Alginate 5%	\n\n\tIndication: Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), Indigestion\n\nDose: Chewable Tablet: Adults and Children >12 years: 2-4 tablets. The tablet must be chewed thoroughly before swallowing.\nOral Liquid: Adults and Children >12 years: Take 10-20 mL (two to four 5 mL spoonfuls). Children 6-12 years: Take 5-10 mL (one to two 5 mL spoonfuls). Administered after meals and at bedtime.\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity\n\nSide effects: Gastrointestinal\n\nGastrointestinal side effects have been reported the most frequently. These have included constipation (secondary to aluminum hydroxide therapy) and diarrhea (secondary to magnesium carbonate therapy). \n\nPatients with renal failure may be at risk of aluminum toxicity because of ingestion of aluminum hydroxide and because of exposure to aluminum-containing water used for dialysate solutions. Adverse effects of aluminum accumulation in these patients has led to monitoring of water source aluminum content by dialysis units and periodic measurements of serum aluminum in patients undergoing chronic dialysis.\n\nConcurrent administration of aluminum hydroxide with citrate containing products has been associated with unusually high serum concentrations of aluminum and, especially in cases of renal failure, severe toxicity. Citrate may increase aluminum solubility and absorption.\n\nDuring long-term use, aluminum has been shown to deposit in bone, joint, and brain.\n\nSigns and symptoms of hypermagnesemia may include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, EKG changes, respiratory depression, loss of deep tendon reflex, dilated pupils, altered mental status, and coma.\n\nMetabolic\n\nMetabolic side effects have included hypophosphatemia with the use of aluminum hydroxide. In patients on long-term aluminum hydroxide therapy, especially in association with poor diets, hypophosphatemia may result in muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and encephalopathy.\n\nOsteomalacia due to aluminum deposition in bone is generally only seen in patients with chronic renal failure. Bone formation slows in response to aluminum bone deposits. Aluminum may also deposit in joint tissue, resulting in arthropathy and hydrarthrosis.\n\nMusculoskeletal side effects have included osteomalacia, due to aluminum hydroxide, which may occur by two different mechanisms. Osteomalacia may occur due to hypophosphatemia or due to aluminum accumulation in bone. Osteomalacia due to hypophosphatemia is often accompanied by malaise, bone pain, muscular weakness, and bone fractures. Osteomalacia due to aluminum deposition may present in a similar fashion and occurs predominately in patients with chronic renal failure. Aluminum deposits typically can be observed on bone biopsy.\nNervous system\n\nEncephalopathy associated with aluminum accumulation is characterized by speech disorders, dysarthria, dyspraxia, dysphasia, tremor, myoclonus, seizures, coma, and ultimately death. EEG of patients with aluminum encephalopathy may show paroxysmal slowing and diffuse rhythmical bursts of delta activity.\nRenal\n\nRenal side effects have rarely included formation of renal calculi, most probably due to hypercalciuria, with the use of aluminum hydroxide.\n\n\nPrecaution: Magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide and alginic acid have not been formally assigned to a pregnancy category by the FDA. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy.  Magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide and alginic acid should only be given in pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

Yellow fever Virus (Live attenuated) Vaccine	\n\n\tSanofi Pasteur S A ,France\tStamaril Injection  1000u/0.5ml 1's pack 1000.63\n\tIndication: Yellow fever infection\n\nDose: Primary Vaccination: Adults and Children >9 months: 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine administered as a single dose.\n\nChildren <9 months: The vaccine must not be given to children <6 months. Vaccination against yellow fever is not usually recommended in children aged from 6 months up to 9 months except in specific circumstances and in accordance with available official recommendations, in which case, the dose is the same as in older children and adults.\n\nThe vaccine should be given at least 10 days before entering an endemic area since protective immunity may not be achieved until at least this time has elapsed.\n\nElderly: The dose is the same as for adults. However, due to a higher risk of yellow fever vaccine-associated severe and potentially fatal disease in persons from 60 years of age, the vaccine should only be given when it is considered that there is a considerable and unavoidable risk of acquiring yellow fever infection.\n\nRe-Vaccination: Re-vaccination with 1 dose of 0.5mL is recommended every 10 years in persons considered to be at risk of exposure. International Health Regulations (IHR) require re-vaccination, using the same dose as for primary vaccination, at intervals of 10 years in order to retain a valid certificate.\n\nFor IM use, the recommended injection sites are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in the infants and toddlers (6 months up to 2 years of age) and the deltoid muscle in older children and adults.\n\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity reaction to eggs, chicken proteins or to any component of this vaccine.\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any yellow fever vaccine.\nImmunosuppression, whether congenital, idiopathic or as a result of treatment with systemic steroids (greater than the standard dose of topical or inhaled steroids), radiotherapy or cytotoxic drugs.\nHistory of thymus dysfunction (including thymoma, thymectomy).\nSymptomatic HIV infection.\nAsymptomatic HIV infection when accompanied by evidence of impaired immune function (see Precautions).\nAge <6 months (see Dosage & Administration and Precautions).\nCurrent severe febrile illness.\n\nSide effects:  Hypersensitivity. The most common adverse reactions occurring after vaccine administration were local reactions. Nervous System Disorders: Very Common: Headache.\nGastrointestinal System Disorders: Common: Nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting. Uncommon: Abdominal pain.\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Common: Myalgia. Uncommon: Arthralgia.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Very Common: Local reactions (including pain, redness, hematoma, induration, swelling). Common: Pyrexia, asthenia.\n\nPrecaution: As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reaction following administration of the vaccine.\nStamaril should be administered only to persons who are or will be at risk of infection with yellow fever virus or who must be vaccinated to comply with IHR.\nImmunosuppressed Persons:It must not be administered to immunosuppressed persons.\nChildren Born to HIV Positive Mothers: Children aged at least 6 months may be vaccinated if it is confirmed that they are not infected with HIV.\nHIV-infected children aged at least 6 months who are potentially in need of protection against yellow fever should be referred to a specialist paediatric team for advice on whether or not to vaccinate.\n This vaccine must not be administered to children before the age of 6 months.\n\nSixty Years and Older: Some serious and potentially fatal adverse reactions (including systemic and neurological reactions persisting >48 hrs, YEL-AVD and YEL-AND) appear to occur at higher frequencies after the age of 60 years. Therefore, the vaccine should only be given to those who have a considerable risk of acquiring yellow fever.\nBecause IM injection can cause injection site haematoma, Stamaril should not be given by the IM route to persons with any bleeding disorder, eg, haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or to persons on anticoagulant therapy. The subcutaneous route of administration should be used instead.\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this vaccine.\n\n\n\nMode of action: Immunosuppressants eg cytotoxic agents, systemic steroids.\n\nPregnancy category: D\n\nInteraction: Immunosuppressants eg cytotoxic agents, systemic steroids.

Vitamin B7 (Biotin)	\n\n\tIndication: Biotin deficiency,  tissue maintenance, healthy skin, nails & hairs, weight loss,  Hairfall, premature greying, neuropathy, relief from heart problems, alopecia, Parkinson’s disease, Rett syndrome and vaginal candidiasis.\n\nDose: An adequate amount of biotin is about 30 to 100 mcg daily. The biotin,  used for nutritional supplement and food labeling purposes, is 300 micrograms/day. \n\nDoses of up to 2,500 mcg have been used safely to treat hair and nail problems. Higher intakes have been recommended for reducing blood sugar levels in diabetics (5-15 mg/d). Vitamin B 7 works best when combined with B-vitamins. \n\nContra-indication: \n\nSide effects: No side effects have been reported for biotin in amounts up to 10 milligrams a day. Like other water soluble B-vitamins, excess biotin is excreted in the urine. Even when taken in high doses (2,500 mcg to treat hair and nail problems), there are no known side effects. In people without disorders of biotin metabolism, doses of up to 5 mg/day for two years were not associated with adverse effects.\n\nPrecaution: Biotin deficiency can be induced in humans by feeding them raw egg whites, which contain a protein that binds biotin and prevents its absorption. Long-term antibiotic use can interfere with biotin production in the intestine and increase the risk of deficiency symptoms, such as dermatitis, depression, hair loss, anemia, and nausea. Long-term use of anti-seizure medications may also lead to biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency results in fatigue, depression, nausea, muscle pains, hair loss, and anemia. Biotin is necessary for both metabolism and growth in humans, particularly with reference to production of fatty acids, antibodies, digestive enzymes, and in niacin (vitamin B3) metabolism. \n\n\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction:

Max: 450 mg as a single dose.\n\nContra-indication: It is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder. Bupropion Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients treated with other medications that contain Bupropion because the incidence of seizure is\ndose dependent. Bupropion may induce seizure and consequently its use is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy. The drug is also contraindicated in patients with a current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or\nanorexia nervosa because of a higher incidence of seizures noted in such patients treated for bulimia with Bupropion Hydrochloride. The concurrent administration of Bupropion Hydrochloride and\na monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of MAO inhibitor and initiation of treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride. Bupropion Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown an allergic response to\nBupropion or the other ingredients that make up Bupropion Hydrochloride.\n\nSide effects: Agitation, anxiety, and insomnia often occur during the initial stages of Bupropion therapy. Other relatively common side effects reported with Bupropion include fever, dry mouth, headache or migraine, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, tremor, sweating, and skin rashes.\nHypersensitivity reactions, ranging from pruritus and urticaria, less commonly, angio-oedema, dyspnoea, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.\n\nPrecaution: It should be used with extreme caution, in patients with history of seizure disorders or in patients with other predisposing factors such as severe hepatic cirrhosis or a CNS tumour, and in those undergoing abrupt withdrawal from alcohol or Benzodiazepines. The use of Bupropion in patients with other risk factors for seizures (for example, alcohol abuse, a history of head trauma, diabetes, and drugs known to lower the seizure threshold) should only be undertaken when there are compelling clinical\nreasons. Bupropion should be used with caution in patients with bipolar depression or psychoses and in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease and in hepatic or renal\nimpairment. \n\nMode of action: Neuroleptics, lithium and TCAs, benzodiazepine, alcohol, drugs that lower seizure threshold. Increased risk of side effects when co-admin with levodopa. Reduced hepatic clearance with fluoxetine. Caution when administering with agents that will affect hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. Increased risk of toxicity when used with ritonavir.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAO inhibitors may cause acute toxicity symptoms and increased risk of fatality.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Neuroleptics, lithium and TCAs, benzodiazepine, alcohol, drugs that lower seizure threshold. Increased risk of side effects when co-admin with levodopa. Reduced hepatic clearance with fluoxetine. Caution when administering with agents that will affect hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. Increased risk of toxicity when used with ritonavir.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAO inhibitors may cause acute toxicity symptoms and increased risk of fatality.

If the effect of 30 mg is insufficient and the side effects are acceptable, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg.\n\nElderly (>65 years): Safety and efficacy of Dapoxetine have not been established in patients >65 years as limited data are available in this population.\n\nChildren and Adolescents: Dapoxetine should not be used in individuals <18 years.\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is required but caution is advised in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Dapoxetine is not recommended for use in the patients with severe renal impairment.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Dapoxetine is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.\n\nBefore treatment is initiated, the physician should obtain a careful medical history focusing on past orthostatic events and also perform an orthostatic test (blood pressure and pulse rate, supine and standing). If the patient discloses a history suggestive of orthostatic reactions or an orthostatic test shows this kind of reaction, treatment with Dapoxetine should be avoided.\n\nContra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to dapoxetine HCl or to any of the excipients.\nPatients with significant pathological cardiac conditions [eg, heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), conduction abnormalities (2nd- or 3rd-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome) not treated with a permanent pacemaker, significant ischemic heart disease or significant valvular disease].\nConcomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI. Similarly, a MAOI should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.\n\nConcomitant treatment with thioridazine, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with thioridazine. Similarly, thioridazine should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.\n\nConcomitant treatment with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)] or other medicinal/herbal products with serotonergic effects or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with these medicinal/herbal products. Similarly these medicinal/herbal products should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.\n\nSide effects: Syncope characterized as loss of consciousness has been reported.The majority of cases occurred during the first 3 hrs after dosing, after the 1st dose or associated with study-related procedures in the clinic setting (eg, blood draw and orthostatic maneuvers and blood pressure measurements). Prodromal symptoms often preceded the syncope.\nOrthostatic hypotension has been reported in clinical trials.\n\nThe most common adverse drug reactions (5%) reported during clinical trials were headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, insomnia and fatigue. The most common events leading to discontinuation were nausea and dizziness.\n\nPrecaution: General: Dapoxetine is only indicated in men with PE. Safety has not been established and there are no data on the ejaculation-delaying effects in men without PE.\n\nUse with Recreational Drugs: Patients should be advised not to use Dapoxetine in combination with recreational drugs. Recreational drugs with serotonergic activity eg, ketamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may lead to potentially serious reactions if combined with Dapoxetine. These reactions include, but are not limited to, arrhythmia, hyperthermia and serotonin syndrome. \n\nUse of Dapoxetine with recreational drugs with sedative properties eg, narcotics and benzodiazepines may further increase somnolence and dizziness.\n\nEthanol: Combining alcohol with Dapoxetine may increase alcohol-related neurocognitive effects and may also enhance neurocardiogenic adverse events eg, syncope, thereby increasing the risk of accidental injury; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Dapoxetine.\n\nPossibly prodromal symptoms eg, nausea, dizziness/lightheadedness and diaphoresis were reported more frequently among patients treated with Dapoxetine compared to placebo.\n\nOrthostatic Hypotension: An orthostatic test should be performed before initiating therapy. In case of a history of documented or suspected orthostatic reaction, treatment with Dapoxetine should be avoided.\n\nDapoxetine is not indicated for psychiatric disorders and should not be used in men with these disorders eg, schizophrenia, or in those suffering with co-morbid depression, as worsening of symptoms associated with depression cannot be excluded.\n\nWithdrawal Effects: Abrupt discontinuation of chronically administered SSRIs used to treat chronic depressive disorders has been reported to result in the following symptoms: Dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (eg, paresthesias, electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia and hypomania.\n\nMode of action: Potential serious reactions w/ MAOIs.

Vitamin B1 + Vitamin B2 + Nicotinamide + Vitamin B6 + Pantothenic Acid + Vitamin C + Biotin + Folic Acid + Vitamin B12 Inj	\n\n\tAristopharma\tArovital Injection  1's vial 200\n\tIndication: It is intended as a supplement for intravenous nutrition in order to meet the daily requirements of the water-soluble vitamins in infants, children and adults. \n\nDose: Adults: For adult patients and children weighing 10 kg or more, the recommended daily doses are the content of 1 vial (10 ml).\n\nChildren: Children weighing less than 10 kg should be given 1/10 of the content of one vial i.e. 1 ml per kg body weight per day.\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the preparation. \n\nSide effects: The unwanted effects of nutrient solutions are a rise in the body temperature, shivering, chills and nausea and vomiting. Other rare unwanted effects include: allergic reactions; breathing difficulties (rapid breathing, shortness of breath); effects on blood pressure, abdominal pain, tiredness, headaches, flushing, slight pressure over the eyes and dizziness. \n\nPrecaution: Administering folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), routine supplementation with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is recommended to prevent deficiency states and to obviate the need to speculate on individual vitamin status. Daily vitamin requirements must be calculated to avoid over dosage and toxic effects, especially with regards to vitamins A & D and particularly in pediatric patients. In patients for whom total parenteral nutrition is continued for prolonged periods (months or years), periodic monitoring of blood vitamin levels should be considered. To prevent excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins and for reasons of safety, daily dosage should be administered over a number of hours. \n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: Not Classified\n\nInteraction: 
Clarithromycin + Metronidazole + Lansoprazol	\n\n\tBeximco\tPylopac TAB dr  7's pack 315\n\tIndication: H. pylori infection, Peptic ulcer disease\n\nDose: One strip lansoprazole, 30 mg; clarithromycin, 500 mg; and metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 7-14 days or as per the physicians advice. \n\nContra-indication: Contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to any component. Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin should not be given to patients with history of QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes. \n\nSide effects: Adverse reactions which were reported as possibly or probably related to treatment (<3%) in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly are listed below and divided by body systems. Digestive system : nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dark stool, glossitis, oral moniliasis, stomatitis, tongue discoloration, Musculoskeletal System : myalgia, Nervous System : confusion, headache, dizziness, Skin : skin reactions, Urological System : vaginitis, vaginal moniliasis. \n\nPrecaution: Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy, including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.\n\nMode of action: Clarithromycin: Reduced efficacy w/ CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine). Strong inducers of CYP450 system (e.g. efavirenz, rifampicin) may accelerate metabolism, thus lower plasma levels of clarithromycin. Inhibition of metabolism w/ ritonavir. Torsades de pointes may result from concomitant quinidine or disopyramide. Increased phosphodiesterase inhibitor exposure w/ sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil. Increased risk of digoxin toxicity. Decreased concentration of zidovudine. Concomitant use w/ atazanavir, itraconazole or saquinavir may result to bi-directional drug interactions. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis may result when taken w/ verapamil. Increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis w/ HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

Increased ototoxicity w/ aminoglycosides. Increased and prolonged sedation w/ triabenzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam).\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine or dihydroergotamine) is associated w/ acute ergot toxicity characterised by vasospasm and ischaemia of the extremities. Concomitant use w/ astemizole, cisapride, pimozide and terfenadine may result in QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nMetronidazole: Concurrent use w/ disulfiram may produce psychotic reactions. May potentiate the effect of oral anticoagulants. May increase risk of lithium toxicity. May reduce the renal clearance resulting to increased toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. May increase serum levels of ciclosporin. May increase plasma levels of busulfan resulting to severe busulfan toxicity. Enhanced metabolism w/ phenobarbital and phenytoin resulting to decreased serum concentrations.\n\nLansoprazole: Increased risk of hypomagnesaemia w/ diuretics and digoxin. May decrease plasma concentration of erlotinib, dasatinib and lapatinib. May decrease the bioavailability of itraconazole and ketoconazole. May increase plasma concentration of cilostazol and methotrexate.

Interstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia associated with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine) have been reported. Medications containing venlafaxine should not be used concomitantly. Renal and hepatic impairment. Safety and efficacy have not been established in paediatrics. Elderly. Pregnancy. Not recommended in lactation.\n\nMode of action: Desvenlafaxine may diminish the therapeutic effect of Iobenguane I-123. May enhance adverse effects of other CNS depressants. Sibutramine and MAOI may enhance the serotonergic effect of Desvenlafaxine; increase risk of development of serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use with alpha-/beta-agonists may enhance tachycardic and vasopressor effect. Desvenlafaxine may increase concentration of CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine); decrease exposure of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) may increase concentration of desvenlafaxine. May enhance the antiplatelet effect of nonselective NSAIDs, aspirin; and anticoagulant effect of warfarin.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAOIs may lead to fatal serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions. Do not use within at least 14 days of discontinuing MAOI treatment and start MAOI at least 7 days after stopping desvenlafaxine. Increased risk of serotonin syndrome with sibutramine.\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction: Desvenlafaxine may diminish the therapeutic effect of Iobenguane I-123.

Eslicarbazepine	\n\n\tSquare\tEslicar TAB dr 400mg 10's pack \n\tIndication: Partial-onset seizures\n\nDose: Adult: PO: The recommended starting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two weeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been established.\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients. Second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block.\n\nSide effects: Allergic reactions: May cause serious skin rash or other serious allergic reactions\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) side effects are:\n• Feeling dizzy or sleepy.\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) side effects are:\n• Feeling unsteady or having a sensation of spinning or floating;\n• Feeling sick or vomiting;\n• Headache;\n• Diarrhoea;\n• Seeing double or blurred vision;\n• Difficulty in concentration;\n• Feeling low in energy or tired;\n• Shaking;\n• Skin rash;\n• Blood tests showing that you have low levels of sodium in your blood;\n• Decrease of appetite;\n• Difficulty in sleeping;\n• Difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia).\n\nPrecaution: Suicidal ideation\nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic active substances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\nNervous system disorders\nEslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.\nOral contraceptives\nEslicarbazepine acetate may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended\nOther warnings and precautions\nIf Eslicarbazepine is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential of increased seizure frequency.\nConcomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may cause overexposure to the active metabolites.\nHyponatraemia\nHyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of patients treated with Eslicarbazepine. Hyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms like worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia increased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease leading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may themselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels should be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum sodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium levels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant hyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued.\nPR interval\nProlongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.\nCaution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac conduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation.\nRenal impairment\nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance. In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is not recommended due to insufficient data.\nHepatic impairment\nAs clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic and clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: C\n\nInteraction:

Insulin degludec + Insulin aspart 70/30 premixed	\n\n\tNovo Nordisk\tRyzodeg FlexTouch Injection 100IU/ml  \n\tIndication: Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults.\n\nDose: Adult: SC: This is a soluble insulin product consisting of the basal insulin degludec and the rapid-acting prandial insulin aspart.\nThis can be administered once- or twice-daily with the main meal(s). When needed, the patient can change the time of administration as long as this insulin is dosed with the largest meal when taken once daily.\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus this insulin can be administered alone, in combination with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, and in combination with bolus insulin.\nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus, this insulin is combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals.\nThis is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient’s needs. Dose-adjustments are recommended to be primarily based on fasting plasma glucose measurements.\n\nInitiation\nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\nThe recommended total daily starting dose is 10 units with meal(s) followed by individual dosage adjustments.\nPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus\nThe recommended starting dose is 60–70% of the total daily insulin requirements. This is to be used once-daily at meal-time in combination.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nThiss insulin can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.\n\n\nContra-indication: Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.\n\nSide effects: The most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia.  \nImmune system disorders\nWith insulin preparations, allergic reactions may occur. Immediate-type allergic reactions to either insulin itself or the excipients may potentially be life-threatening.\nWith Ryzodeg, hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhoea, nausea, tiredness and itching) and urticaria were reported rarely.\n\nLipodystrophy\nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the particular injection area may help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions.\nInjection site reactions\nInjection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) occurred in patients treated with\nRyzodeg. These reactions are usually mild and transitory and they normally disappear during continued treatment.\n\n\n\nPrecaution: Hypoglycaemia\nOmission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Concomitant illness, especially infections and fever, usually increases the patient's insulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose.\n\n\nHyperglycaemia\nAdministration of rapid-acting insulin is recommended in situations with severe hyperglycaemia. Inadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of treatment in patients requiring insulin may lead to hyperglycaemia and potentially to diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially infections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased insulin requirement.\n\nEye disorder\nIntensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups\nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between Ryzodeg and other insulin products.\n\nOlder patients (? 65 years old)\nRyzodeg can be used in older patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.\n\nPaediatric population\nRyzodeg has been administered to children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for the investigation of pharmacokinetic properties. Safety and efficacy have not been investigated in children and adolescents.\n\n\n\n\nMode of action: None\n\nPregnancy category: B\n\nInteraction:

Fat emulsion should comprise no more than 60% of the patient's total caloric intake, with carbohydrates and amino acids comprising the remaining 40% or more of caloric intake. \n\nAdult: Initial infusion rate is 1ml/min for the first 15 to 30 mins. If no adverse reactions occur, the infusion rate can be increased to 2 ml/min. Infuse only 500 ml the first day and increase dose the following day. Do not exceed a daily dosage of 2.5 g/kg. \nChildren: Initial infusion rate is 0.1ml/min for the first 10 to 15 mins. If no adverse reactions occur, the infusion rate can be increased to 1g/kg in 4 hours. Do not exceed a daily dosage of 3 g/kg. \nInfants: Starts at 0.5g/kg/24 hours and may be increased in relation to the infant's ability to eliminate fat. The maximum recommended dosage is 3g/kg/24 hours. \nFatty acid deficiency: To correct EFAD, supply 8% to 10% of the caloric intake by IV fat emulsion to provide an adequate amount of linoleic acid. \n\nContra-indication: It is contraindicated in conditions with severely disordered fat metabolism, such as in severe liver damage and acute shock. Hypersensitivity to egg-, soya- or peanut protein or to any of active substances or excipients.\n\nSide effects: This may cause a rise in body temperature (incidence <3%) and, less frequently, shivering, chills and nausea/vomiting (incidence <1%). Reports of other adverse events in conjunction with 10% fat emulsion infusion are extremely rare, less than one report of certain events per one million infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic reaction, skin rash, urticaria), respiratory symptoms (tachypnoea) and circulatory effects (hypertension, hypotension) have been described. \nThrombosis, haemolysis, reticulocytosis, abdominal pain, tiredness, priapism and neurological adverse reactions including headaches, flushing, dyspnoea, slight pressure over the eyes and dizziness have been reported.\n\nPrecaution: This contains soya oil and egg lecithin which may rarely cause allergic reactions. Cross allergic reaction has been observed between soya-bean and peanut. Fat metabolism may be disturbed in conditions such as renal insufficiency, uncompensated diabetes, pancreatitis, certain forms of liver insufficiency, metabolic disorders and sepsis. Fatisol should be administered with caution as a strong correlation exists between C-reactive protein and the agglutination of Fatisol in seriously ill patients. \n\nIt should be given with caution to neonates and premature infants with hyperbilirubinaemia and in cases with suspected pulmonary hypertension. In low birthweight infants, the risk of lipid infusions may outweigh potential benefits due to further diminution of defences against infection. In infants, metabolism of lipids in peripheral tissues may be diminished by infection and heparin administration. In neonates receiving long term parenteral nutrition, particularly premature neonates, platelet count, liver function tests and serum triglyceride concentration should be monitored.
