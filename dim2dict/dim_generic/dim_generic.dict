Precaution: Regular monitoring of blood counts. History of heart disease, hepatic or renal insufficiency, weak or malnourished patients, patients who with history of high-dose pelvic radiation or use of alkylating agents. Patients with widespread metastases to the bone marrow.

Mode of action: Fluorouracil interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. It also interferes with RNA synthesis. This results in an unbalanced growth of the cells. Fluorouracil exerts greater effect on rapidly growing cells as they take up the drug at a faster rate.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: May increase warfarin effects. May reduce response to vaccines; possibility of generalized infection with live vaccines. Action may be modified by allopurinol. Leucovorin calcium may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil.Square	Tivizid TAB dr   10's pack 1405.28 BDT
	Indication: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

Dose:  Adults and Adolescents >12 years: Recommended Dose: 1 tablet twice daily.
This should not be administered to adolescents and adults who weigh &lt;40 kg because it is a fixed-dose tablet, therefore the dose cannot be reduced.

Renal Impairment: Dosage reduction of lamivudine or zidovudine may be necessary in renally impaired patients. It is therefore recommended that separate preparations of abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine should be administered to patients with reduced renal function (CrCl &lt;50 mL/min).

Hepatic Impairment: This drugs is contraindicated for use in hepatically impaired patients.

Administration: Trizivir can be taken with or without food.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity. Hepatic impairment, abnormally low neutrophil counts (&lt;0.75 x 10 9/L) or abnormally low Hb levels (&lt;7.5 g/dL or 4.65 mmol/L). Patient &lt;40 kg, CrCl &lt;50 mL/min.

Side effects: Hypersensitivity reactions (discontinue immediately & do not rechallenge), GI disturbances, anorexia, headache, insomnia, muscle disorders, myalgia, cough, rash, alopecia, fever, malaise, fatigue, severe hepatomegaly w/ steatosis & lactic acidosis.

Precaution: Use of abacavir in patients known to carry HLA B*5701 allele is not recommended. Screening should be performed before initiating treatment or prior to reinitiation in patients w/ unknown HLA B*5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir. Hypersensitivity reaction. Risk of lactic acidosis & hepatomegaly w/ steatosis in patients (esp obese women w/ hepatomegaly), pancreatitis, hepatitis or other known risk factors for hepatic disease. Due to haematological AR, monitor haematological parameters during treatment esp in patients w/ poor bone marrow reserve or advanced HIV disease. Discontinue immediately if pancreatitis is suspected. Co-infection w/ HBV or HCV. Immune reconstitution syndrome, opportunistic infections, transmission of infection, MI. Elderly. Pregnancy & lactation.

Mode of action: Abacavir, lamivudine and zidovudine are all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Converted to their respective active triphosphate form, they act synergistically to reduce viral resistance and inhibit reverse transcriptase via DNA chain termination.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Abacavir: Alcohol may cause decreased elimination of abacavir. Lactic acidosis with nucleoside analogues concomitantly. Decreased serum concentrations of methadone.

Zidovudine: acyclovir and valacyclovir may increase CNS depression. Increased risk of haematologic toxicity with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, dapsone, doxorubicin, vincristine and vinblastine. Doxorubicin may reduce phophorylation; fluconazole may increase levels/effects; increased risk of hepatic decompensation or haematologic toxicities with interferon-? and ribavirin (also increases risk of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis). Methadone may increase effects/levels. Increased risk of myalgia, malaise and/or fever, maculopapular rash and effects/levels with probenecid. Stavudine may decrease antiviral activity; valproic acid may increase plasma levels (AUC increased by 80%).

Lamivudine: Increased risk of hepatic decompensation or haematologic toxicities with interferon-? and ribavirin (also increases risk of mitochondrial toxicity, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis). Ganciclovir and valganciclovir may increase effects and toxicity; sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim may increase AUC and decrease clearance (increasing levels and effects).Pacific	Sugatrol TAB dr 100mg 30's pack 760 BDT

	Indication: Recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores)

Dose: Adults and children >6 years :
The cream should be topically applied 5 times per day for 5 days. Therapy should be initiated as early as possible after the first signs and symptoms.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: The following most common adverse reactions (&lt; 1%) were local skin reactions like drying or flaking of the skin; burning or tingling, erythema; pigmentation changes, application site reactions including signs and symptoms of inflammation.

Precaution: Aciclovir and Hydrocortisone should not be used in the eye, inside the mouth or nose, or on the genitals. Patients should seek medical advice when a cold sore fails to heal within 2 weeks.

Mode of action: Aciclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) in cell culture and in vivo. The inhibitory activity of Aciclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV. This viral enzyme converts Aciclovir into Aciclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. 

In cell culture, Aciclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase. 

Hydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. It is used topically for its anti-inflammatory effects which suppress the clinical manifestations of the disease in a wide range of disorders where inflammation is a prominent feature.

Contra-indication: Cyanide, mineral acids, caustic alkalis, organic solvents, iron, ethanol, methanol poisoning; lithium, methionine; intestinal obstruction, anatomically-broken GI tract, haemorrhage or GI perforation. Concomitant use of charcoal with sorbitol: Patients with fructose intolerance; Childn <1 yr.

Side effects: Vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, black stools, swelling of abdomen, bowel obstruction; platelet aggregation, charcoal embolism, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypothermia, hypotension (haemoperfusion with activated charcoal); blackening of teeth and mouth; hypernatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypermagnesemia (with concomitant admin with cathartics).

Precaution: Decreased peristalsis: administer within 1 hr of ingestion. Induce vomiting of ipecac syr before admin of charcoal to prevent adsorption of ipecac. Petroleum distillate, caustic ingestions may harm gastric lining upon induction of vomiting by charcoal. Limit admin of charcoal in sorbitol doses to prevent loss of fluid and electrolyte. Monitor for active bowel sounds before administering charcoal. Pregnancy.

Mode of action: Charcoal due to its large surface area, inhibits the GI absorption of toxic substances or irritants eg, aromatic or benzenoid-type substances through adsorption. As a laxative, the addition of sorbitol provides hyperosmotic environment thus causing catharsis. Moreover, charcoal interferes with the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids resulting to a lower cholesterol level.

Contra-indication: Preexisting hypertension; occlusive vascular disease; angle-closure glaucoma (eye drops); hypersensitivity; cardiac arrhythmias or tachycardia. When used in addition to local anaesthetics: Procedures involving digits, ears, nose, penis or scrotum.

Side effects: CNS effects; GI disturbances; epigastric pain; CV disorders; difficulty in micturition with urinary retention; dyspnoea; hyperglycaemia; sweating; hypersalivation; weakness, tremors; coldness of extremities; hypokalaemia. Gangrene, tissue necrosis and sloughing (extravasation) when used in addition to local anaesthetics. Eye drops: Severe smarting, blurred vision, photophobia; naso-lachrymal ducts obstruction. Oedema, hyperaemia and inflammation of the eyes with repeated administration.

Precaution: CV diseases; hyperthyroidism; DM; Parkinson's disease; elderly; pregnancy, lactation.

Mode of action: Epinephrine, an active principle of the adrenal medulla, is a direct-acting sympathomimetic. It stimulates alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors resulting in relaxation of smooth muscle of the bronchial tree, cardiac stimulation and dilation of skeletal muscle vasculature. It is frequently added to local anaesthetics to retard diffusion and limit absorption, to prolong the duration of effect and to lessen the danger of toxicity.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Halogenated inhalation anaesthetics; alpha- or beta-blocking agents; methyldopa, guanethidine; drugs with vasoconstrictor and pressor effects; antihypertensives; adrenergic neuron blockers; potassium-depleting drugs; cardiac glycosides; ephedra, yohimbe. TCAs may induce hypertension and arrhythmia.Gonoshasthaya	G Lignocaine 2% Injection   50 ml vial x 1's pack 28.42 BDT

	Indication: Local or regional anesthesia, nerve blocks, epidural and caudal anaesthesia

Dose: Adult: Per ml prep contains lidocaine HCl 20 mg and epinephrine 5 mcg. Dosage depends on several factors such as route, type and extent of surgical procedure, duration of anaesthesia and patient's condition and age. Max dose of lidocaine given with epinephrine: 7 mg/kg and not >500 mg.

Child: 3 mth-12 yr: Per ml prep contains lidocaine HCl 20 mg and epinephrine 5 mcg. Dosage depends on several factors such as route, type and extent of surgical procedure, duration of anaesthesia and patient's condition and age. Max dose 3 mg/kg. Ideal body weight should be used in children with high body weight. Reconstitution: Can be diluted if necessary in glucose 5%, sodium chloride 0.9% and lactated Ringer's solution.

Contra-indication: Tachycardia, hypertension, cerebral arteriosclerosis, ischaemic heart disease, IV admin, anaesthetise digits or appendages, myasthenia gravis.

Side effects: Severity of adverse effects in CNS and CVS are directly related to blood levels of lidocaine; the effects are more likely to occur after systemic administration rather than infiltration; dizziness; muscle twitching; local anaesthetic of mouth/throat impairs swallowing and increases the risk of aspiration (patients cautioned against eating or drinking for 3-4 hr after anaesthesia); transient effect on auditory system of neonate; erythema; pigmentation; pain; headache; palpitations; local necrosis; pulmonary oedema; hyperglycaemia; bradycardia; reduced cardiac output; anxiety. 

Epidural may cause hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting. Intraoral inj may cause stress reactions such as diaphoresis, palpitation, hyperventilation, generalised pallor and faintness. Topically: papules, burns, rash, skin irritation, burning sensation and blanching.

Potentially Fatal: Severity of adverse effects in CNS and CVS related to blood levels of lidocaine; effects more likely to occur after systemic administration rather than infiltration. CNS toxicity (due to inadvertent IV admin), medullary depression with tonic & clonic convulsions; ventricular fibrillation; severe hypertension with cerebral haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema; unconsciousness; possibly respiratory arrest. Allergic reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and possibly life threatening asthmatic episodes in susceptible patients may occur due to sodium metabisulphate constituent. 

Central nerve blocks may cause CV depression (especially in hypovolaemia). Retrobulbar inj may reach subarachnoid space causing CV collapse, apnoea, convulsions, temporary blindness. Paracervical block may cause foetal bradycardia/tachycardia (careful monitoring of foetal heart rate is necessary).

Precaution: Epilepsy, impaired cardiac conduction, CHF, DM, closed angle glaucoma, impaired liver function (if site of admin is likely to result in high blood levels), severe renal dysfunction. Local anaesthetic effect may be reduced if injected into an inflamed or infected area. Cerebrovascular insufficiency, hyperthyroidism. Neonates, elderly, patients in poor general condition (optimise patient's condition before major block), pregnancy.

Mode of action: Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic which decreases permeability of sodium ions, blocking induction and conduction of nerve impulses. Combination with epinephrine restricts systemic spread of lidocaine, vascular absorption and its duration of local anaesthetic effect.

	Indication: Major depressive disorder

Dose: 25-50 mg at bedtime.

Contra-indication: Co-administration of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (eg fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin). Hepatic impairment.

Side effects: Dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, migraine, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, upper abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis, back pain, tiredness, anxiety, elevated liver enzymes.

Precaution: Suicidal thoughts & worsening of depression. Mania, dementia, lactose intolerance. May affect ability to drive or operate machinery. Pregnancy & lactation. Childn & adolescent <18 yr.

Mode of action: Agomelatine possesses both melatonin receptor (MT1 and MT2) agonist and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT2C) antagonist properties. These properties act in a complementary and perhaps synergistic manner to improve depressed states by resynchronization of circadian rhythms, enhancement of dopaminergic and adrenergic input to the frontal cortex, induction of neurogenesis, as well as through other mechanisms. Furthermore, melatonergic agonism and 5-HT2C receptor antagonism also act in harmony to favourably influence anxious symptoms, sleep and sexual function.

Use in pregnancy & lactation: No experience has been made so far with the application in pregnancy and lactation.
Use in children: No experience has been made so far with the application in paediatric.

Mode of action: Amino acids, including combinations with polypeptides. This allows the intake of essential amino acids while minimizing the amino-nitrogen intake. Following absorption, the keto- and hydroxyanalogues are transaminated to the corresponding essential amino acids by taking nitrogen from non-essential amino acids, thereby decreasing the formation of urea by re-using the amino group. Hence, the accumulation of uraemic toxins is reduced.

	Indication: Hyperhidrosis. 

Dose: Topical

Apply solution to completely dry affected area (e.g., underarms, palms, soles, scalp) once daily at bedtime and washed off the following morning. Repeat applications for >2 consecutive nights until desired effect (lack of sweating) achieved.Thereafter, may apply additional treatments once or twice weekly as needed.

Apply only to affected areas you need to treat. It is usually used around the armpits, hands or feet, and is most effective when applied to small areas of skin, helping to prevent lasting side effects as a result of blocking too many sweat glands. 

Contra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to aluminum chloride hexahydrate or any ingredient in the formulation.

Side effects: Local skin irritation (burning, stinging, itching, tingling).

Precaution: Aluminium Chloride Hexahydrate is suitable for use only on small areas at a time and not for wide spread usage. Pregnancy and lactation. Avoid contact with eyes.Keep preparations out of reach of children.Risk of skin sensitivity increases with higher concentrations,

This medication may stain clothing or certain fabrics or harm metals. Use this medication cautiously to avoid contact with clothes, bed linens, other fabrics, or metals. Let this medication dry completely before putting clothing over the treated area.

Mode of action: The exact mechanism of action of antiperspirants is unknown. The most widely held position is that the metal salts contained in antiperspirants physically obstruct the ductal opening of the sweat gland. 
Several studies have shown that aluminum salts cause an obstruction of the distal sweat gland ducts. A mechanism underlying this obstruction has been proposed: the metal ions precipitate with mucopolysaccharides, damaging epithelial cells along the lumen of the duct and forming a plug that blocks sweat output.

Dose: Adult: PO Antacid Up to 1 g/day. Hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure Up to 10 g/day in divided doses w/ meals.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to aluminium salts.

Side effects: Constipation; intestinal obstruction (with large doses); phosphate depletion may occur with prolonged admin or large doses.

Precaution: Chronic renal impairment; CHF; oedema; cirrhosis and low Na diets; patients with recent GI haemorrhage. Administer 2-3 hrs before/after another medication to minimise drug interactions. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Alumunium hydroxide acts on the HCl in the stomach by neutralization, forming aluminium chloride salt and water.
Magnesium hydroxide increases peristaltic activity causing osmotic retention of fluids, thus resulting in bowel evacuation. It also reduces stomach acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid to form Mg chloride.


Pregnancy category: C

Dose: Initiate treatment at 5 mg once daily, and consider increasing the dose to 10 mg once daily if 5 mg is tolerated. 

Dose adjustment of Letairis in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is therefore not required. There is no information on the exposure to ambrisentan in patients with severe renal impairment.

It is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.


Contra-indication: Ambrisentan  may  cause  fetal  harm  when  administered  to  a  pregnant  woman.  Ambrisentan  is  contraindicated  in  women  who  are  or  may  become  pregnant.  If  this  drug  is  used  during  pregnancy,  or  if  the  patient  becomes  pregnant  while  taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.  Pregnancy must be excluded before the initiation of treatment with Ambrisentan  and  prevented  during  treatment  and  for  one  month  after  stopping  treatment. Ambrisentan is contraindicated in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) including IPF patients with pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group 3).

Side effects: Most common adverse reactions are peripheral edema, nasal congestion, sinusitis, and flushing. Decreases  in  hemoglobin  concentration  and  hematocrit  have  followed  administration  of  other endothelin  receptor  antagonists  and  were  observed  in  clinical studies with Ambrisentan.



Precaution: Fluid Retention: Peripheral edema is a known class e¬ect of endothelin receptor antagonists, and is also a clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH. 
Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease: If patients develop acute pulmonary edema during initiation of therapy with vasodilating agents such as Ambrisentan, the possibility of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease should be considered, and if confirmed. Ambrisentan should be discontinued. 
Hematological Changes: Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have followed administration of other endothelin receptor antagonists and were observed in clinical studies with Ambrisentan. 
Hepatic impairment: Ambrisentan is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.




Mode of action: High affinity endothelin (ETa) receptor subtype antagonist, resulting in inhibition of vasoconstriction.

	Indication: Mucolytic, Productive cough, Acute and chronic inflammatory disorders of upper and lower respiratory tracts associated with viscid mucus including acute and chronic bronchitis, laryngitis, Pharyngitis, sinusitis and rhinitis associated with viscid mucus, Asthmatic bronchitis, bronchial asthma with thick expectoration, Bronchiectasis, Chronic pneumonia.

Dose: Paediatric Drops : 
0 - 6 months old - 0.5 ml, 2 times a day, 
6 - 12 months old - 1 ml, 2 times a day, 
1 - 2 years old -1.25 ml, 2 times a day. 

Syrup : 2 -5 years old - 2.5 ml (1/2 teaspoonful), 2-3 times a day, 
5 - 10 years old - 5 ml (1 teaspoonful), 2-3 times a day, 
10 years old and adults - 10 ml (2 teaspoonful), 3 times a day. 

SR Capsule : Adults and children over 12 years old - 1 capsule, once daily 

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in known hypersensitivity to Ambroxol or Bromhexine.

Side effects: Mild GI effects and allergic reactions.

Precaution: Ambroxol should be given cautiously to patients with gastric and duodenal ulceration or convulsive disorders. Patients with hepatic and renal insufficiency should take it with caution.

Mode of action: Ambroxol is a metabolite of Bromhexine. It possesses mucokinetic (improvement in mucus transport) and secretolytic (liquefies secretions) properties. Ambroxol stimulates the serous cells of the glands of the mucous membrane of bronchi, increasing the content of mucus secretion. The mucolytic effect is associated with depolymerization and splitting of mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharide fibres, which leads to reduction in the viscosity of mucus. Expectoration of mucus is facilitated and breathing is eased considerably. Ambroxol stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells. Ambroxol has anti-inflammatory properties. In patients with COPD, it improves airway patency.

Contra-indication: Hyperkalaemia; anuria; acute renal failure, severe progressive renal disease; severe hepatic failure, precoma associated with hepatic cirrhosis; Addison's disease; hypercalcaemia; diabetic neuropathy; DM. Child <18 yr. Lactation.

Side effects: Electrolyte imbalance e.g. hyponatraemia, hypochloraemic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Anaphylaxis, back pain, chest pain, fatigue, fever, headache, malaise, neck/shoulder ache, pain in extremities, syncope, weakness; angina, arrhythmias, digitalis toxicity, orthostatic hypotension, necrotising angiitis, palpitation and tachycardia; 
GI disturbances; agranulocytosis, aplastic anaemia, haemolytic anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia, purpura and thrombocytopenia; alopecia, diaphoresis, dry mouth, flushing, photosensitivity, pruritis, rash, sialadenitis and urticaria; glycosuria, gout, hyperglycaemia and hyperuricaemia; joint pain, leg ache and muscle cramps; dizziness, encephalopathy, paraesthesia, stupor, tremors, vertigo; decreased libido, depression, insomnia, mental confusion, nervousness, restlessness, sleepiness and somnolence; cough, dyspnoea and respiratory distress; bad taste, increased intraocular pressure, nasal congestion, tinnitus, visual disturbance and xanthopsia; bladder spasm, dysuria, impotence, incontinence, interstitial nephritis, nocturia, polyuria, renal dysfunction.

Precaution: Renal impairment; BUN >10 mmol/L, serum creatinine >130 mmol/L. Monitor serum electrolytes and blood urea levels in seriously ill patients e.g. those with hepatic cirrhosis with ascites and metabolic alkalosis, or those with resistant oedema. Pre-existing severe liver disease. May affect parathyroid function. Hyperuricaemia or gout may occur. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be increased. Thiazides may impair glucose tolerance. DM may be precipitated or aggravated. May activate or exacerbate SLE. Elderly. Hyponatraemia. Pregnancy.

Mode of action: Amiloride is an antikaliuretic with weak natriuretic, diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Some clinical studies found these effects to be partially additive to the effects of thiazide diuretics. Amiloride exerts its potassium-sparing effect by inhibiting Na reabsorption at the distal renal tubules; this decreases the net -ve potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both K and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive. It reduces electrolyte reabsorption from the renal tubules. Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of Na and chloride in approx equiv amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of K and bicarbonate. It exerts its hypotensive effect partly by reducing peripheral resistance.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction:  	Additive effects with other antihypertensives. May increase the responsiveness to tubocurarine. May reduce arterial responsiveness to pressor amines e.g. norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension may occur with alcohol, barbiturates and narcotics. Discontinue diuretics 2-3 days before initiation of an ACE inhibitor to reduce the likelihood of 1st dose hypotension. Increased hypokalaemia with corticosteroids or ACTH. Attenuation of diuretic, natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of diuretics with NSAIDs. Increased hyponatraemia with chlorpropamide. Increased hyperkalaemia with ciclosporin, tacrolimus, indometacin and angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
Potentially Fatal: Increases risk of hyperkalaemia with other potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone or triamterene). Increases risk of lithium toxicity.Acme Ltd.	Aminoplex IV Infusion 5 %   BDT
	Indication: Parenteral nutrition

Dose: Adults: The nitrogen requirement for maintenance of body protein mass depends on the patient's condition (nutritional state and degree of metabolic stress). No or minor metabolic stress and normal nutritional state: 0.10-0.15 g nitrogen/kg/day, Moderate metabolic stress with or without malnutrition: 0.15-0.20 g nitrogen/kg/day, Severe catabolism as in burns, sepsis and trauma: up to 0.20-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day. The dosage range 0.10-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day corresponds to 15-35 ml amino acid IV/kg/day. In obese patients, the dose should be based on the estimated ideal weight. Depending upon patients requirements, 1000-2000 ml amino acid may be infused intravenously per 24 hours. It should be infused slowly, at rates 1.4-2.8 ml (30-60 drops) per minute. Infants and Children: In children and infants, the rate of infusion is 28-35 ml/kg body wt/day is recommended, with a stepwise increment in the rate of administration during the first week of treatment.

Contra-indication: contraindicated in patients with inborn errors of amino acids metabolism. Moreover, amino acid should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.

Side effects: It is usually well tolerated. Yet nausea, vomiting, flushing and sweating have been observed during infusion of amino acid IV at rates exceeding the recommended maximal rate. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Like all hypertonic infusion solution, thrombophlebitis may occur when peripheral veins are used. The incidence may be reduced by the simultaneous infusion of 10% fat emulsion. If it is infused to severely ill patients, premature infants, hyperphenylalaninemia may occur.

Precaution: Hyperphenylalaninemia has been noted in severely ill, premature infants. In these patients, monitoring of the phenylalanine levels is recommended and the infusion rate adjusted as needed. Do not use if the solution is turbid or contains particles. Discard any unused portion.

Mode of action: Provides nutritional requirements that support neurotransmitter synthesis and physiological activities involved in neuropathic pain; helps restore nutrient balance of arginine, choline, glutamine, histidine, tryptophan, and serine which support the balance of the neurotransmitters GABA, histamine, nitric oxide, serotonin, and acetylcholine

Under usual physiological conditions, glutamine, arginine, serine, and choline are considered nonessential because endogenous synthesis is sufficient to satisfy metabolic demand; with neuropathic pain, the usual rate of synthesis is no longer sufficient and these nutrients become conditionally essential, requiring that supplemental amounts be consumed.

	Indication: Prevent nitrogen loss, Negative nitrogen balance, Nutritional therapy

Dose: For peripheral intravenous infusion, 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism. Infusion or ingestion of carbohydrate or lipid will not reduce the nitrogen sparing effect of intravenous amino acid infusions at this dose.
As with all intravenous fluid therapy, the primary aim is to provide sufficient water to compensate for insensible, urinary, and other fluid losses (nasogastric suction, fistula drainage, and diarrhea).  Infused at a rate of 45 mL/kg/day, will meet the fluid and amino acid requirements of the stable adult patient.
As reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia.

Contra-indication: This preparation should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.

Side effects:  it can be infused through a peripheral vein paying great care to the possible occurrence of local reactions. Local reactions consisting of a warm sensation, erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids; in such cases the infusion site should be changed promptly to another vein. Use of large peripheral veins, inline filters, and slower rates of infusion may reduce the incidence of local venous irritation. Electrolyte additives should be spread throughout the day. Irritating additive medications may need to be injected at another venous site.

Generalized flushing, fever and nausea have been reported during peripheral infusions of amino acid solutions.

Precaution: Special care must be taken when administering glucose solutions to provide calories in diabetic or prediabetic patients. To control and minimize possible hyperglycemia and consequent glycosuria, it is desirable to monitor blood and urine glucose and, if necessary, add insulin.

Because of its antianabolic activity, concurrent administration of tetracycline may reduce the nitrogen sparing effects of infused amino acids.

Feeding regimens which include amino acids should be used with caution in patients with history of renal disease, pulmonary disease, or with cardiac insufficiency so as to avoid excessive fluid accumulation.

Nitrogen intake should be carefully monitored in patients with impaired renal function.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to amiodarone or iodine. Severe sinus node dysfunction, 2nd and 3rd degree heart block (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker), cardiogenic shock, pregnancy.

Side effects: Blue-grey discolouration of skin, photosensitivity, peripheral neuropathy, paraesthesia, myopathy, ataxia, tremor, nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, alopoecia, sleep disturbances, corneal microdeposits, hot flushes, sweating. Heart block, bradycardia, sinus arrest, hepatotoxicity, heart failure.
Potentially Fatal: Pulmonary toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, thyrotoxicity. Ventricular arrhythmias, pulmonary alveolitis, exacerbation of arrhythmias and rare serious liver injury. Generally in patients with high doses and having preexisting abnormalities of diffusion capacity.

Precaution: Close monitoring is recommended as amiodarone may worsen arrhythmia especially when used concurrently with other anti-arrhythmic drugs or drugs that prolong QT interval. May cause hypotension and bradycardia. May increase risk of liver toxicity. May cause visual disturbance/impairment; corneal refractive laser surgery is not recommended in patients on amiodarone treatment. May cause lung damage; monitor for pulmonary toxicity e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome. Monitor liver functions regularly. May affect defibrillation or pacing thresholds of cardiac devices. Correct electrolyte imbalance before starting treatment. Caution when used in patients undergoing surgery. Avoid excessive sunlight exposure due to increased risk of photosensitivity. Hepatic impairment, thyroid disease, elderly. Lactation.

Mode of action: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent which inhibits stimulation, prolongs action potential and refractory period in myocardial tissues. It also decreases AV conduction and sinus node function. Sinus rate is reduced by 15-20%, PR and QT intervals are increased. Amiodarone can cause marked sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest and heart block. In acute IV doses, amiodarone may exert a mild negative inotropic effect.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Potentiation of antiarrhythmic drugs. Possible increased risk of adverse effects when used with anaesthetic agents. Monitor plasma levels of amiodarone when used with HIV protease inhibitors. Cimetidine may increase serum levels of amiodarone. Concurrent use may increase serum levels of ciclosporin. May increase risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis when used with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rifampin may reduce the serum levels of amiodarone.
Potentially Fatal: Potentiates the effect of warfarin and other anticoagulants hence dose of warfarin generally needs to be reduced approx half. Raised plasma concentrations of digoxin, phenytoin and quinidine. Additive effect with beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers (e.g. verapamil and diltiazem).Albion Ltd.

	Indication: Mild to moderate hypertension, Chronic stable and vasospastic angina, Raynaud's disease, Coronary Artery Disease, HTN, Stroke prevention

Dose: Adult: PO Stable angina; HTN; Prinzmetal's angina Initial: 5 mg once daily;  If the desired therapeutic effect cannot be achieved within 2-4 weeks, the dose may be increased to a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. 

Child: >12 yr Initially, 2.5 mg once daily, increased to 5 mg once daily if necessary.
Elderly: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.
Hepatic impairment: Initially, 2.5 mg once daily.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to Amlodipine or other calcium channel antagonist, Severe hypertension.

Side effects: Headache, peripheral oedema, fatigue, somnolence, nausea, abdominal pain, flushing, dyspepsia, palpitations, dizziness. Rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia, muscle cramps.Potentially Fatal: Hypotension, bradycardia, conductive system delay and CCF.

Precaution: Impaired liver or renal function, CHF, sick-sinus syndrome, severe ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis. Caution when used in patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Elderly, children. Pregnancy, lactation.  Use in renal failure: Although Amlodipine is excreted primarily via kidney, mild renal impairment does not appear to have an effect on the plasma concentrations. Severe renal impairment may however require a dosage reduction. Amlodipine is not dialyzable. Use in patients with impaired hepatic function: Amlodipine half-life is prolonged in patient with impaired hepatic function. Amlodipine should therefore be administered at lower (5mg) initial dose in these patients. Use in heart failure: An increased number of pulmonary oedema has been reported.

Mode of action: Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Plasma concentrations may be elevated w/ CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, ritonavir). Concomitant therapy w/ simvastatin may increase risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis. May increase ciclosporin plasma levels and conivaptan.ACI	Tenocab 5/25 TAB dr  25mg+5mg 50's pack 263.50 BDT

	Indication: Patients with essential hypertension; Patients with angina pectoris & hypertension as co-existing diseases; In post MI patients; In patients with refractory angina pectoris where nitrate therapy has failed.

Dose: Adult: PO HTN; Chronic stable angina Per tab contains amlodipine (besylate) 5 mg and atenolol 25 or 50 mg: 1 tab once daily, up to 2 tab/day if needed.

Contra-indication: Hypotension, sinus bradycardia, 2nd & 3rd degrees of heart block, cardiogenic shock, overt congestive failure, poor LV function, hypersensitivity to either component, pregnancy.

Side effects: Headache, hypotension, dizziness, breathlessness, fatigue, muscle cramps, bradycardia, palpitations, flushing, oedema, dyspnoea, dyspepsia, cold extremities. Drowsiness, chestpain & impotence rarely. Hypersensitivity reactions.

Precaution: Excessive fall of BP may occur in elderly patients. Caution in patients with COPD, thyrotoxicosis, congestive failure, vasospastic angina, hepatic & renal impairment. Caution in diabetic patients as beta-blockers may mask tachycardia occurring with hypoglycaemia. Withdrawal should be gradual. Lactation. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Not to be used in untreated phaeochromocytoma.

Mode of action: Atenolol is a cardioselective beta blocker. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker that blocks the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Combination of the two drugs results in additive antihypertensive action.

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.ACI	Cacetor 2.5/10 CAP   24's pack 96 BDT

	Indication: Hypertension

Dose: Adult: PO Per combination cap contains Amlodipine 2.5-10 mg and benazepril 10-40 mg: Amlodipine component: 2.5-10 mg once daily; benazepril component: 10-40 mg once daily.

Contra-indication: Patients with history of angioedema; pregnancy, lactation.

Side effects: Cough, oedema (including dependent oedema, angioedema, facial oedema, peripheral oedema), headache, dizziness, flushing, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, asthenia, fatigue, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, musculoskeletal pain, skin rash, insomnia, anxiety, decreased libido, acute renal disease, palpitation, angina pectoris, bradycardia, chest pain, jaundice, hepatic enzymes elevations, increased creatinine and BUN, haemolytic anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, pemphigus.
Potentially Fatal: Analphylactoid reactions, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Precaution: Discontinue Amlodipine+Benazepril as soon as possible if pregnancy is detected. Caution in elderly, renal or hepatic impairment, congestive heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, use during surgery or anaesthesia. Amlodipine+Benazepril can cause symptomatic hypotension, especially in patients with salt/volume depletion. ACE inhibitors (ACEi) have been associated with cholestatic jaundice and fulminant hepatic necrosis; discontinue treatment if patient develops jaundice/marked elevation of liver enzymes. Monitor renal function and serum potassium periodically. Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, larynx and intestinal angioedema have been reported in ACEi-treated patients. As with all ACEi, may cause persistent dry cough. Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients have not been established.

Mode of action: Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. It lowers BP by relaxing the coronary vascular smooth muscles and producing coronary vasodilation; through inhibition of transmembrane Ca ion influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. It is also a peripheral vascular vasodilator. Benazepril and its active metabolite benazeprilat inhibit ACE, which results in decreased plasma angiotensin II and thus leading to decreased aldosterone secretion.

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.ACI	Abecab 5/20 TAB dr  20mg+5mg 30's pack 241.50 BDT

	Indication: Hypertension

Dose: Adult: Initial: 10-20 mg once daily. Antihypertensive effect is substantially present within 2 wk of therapy initiation. Dose may be increased up to 40 mg once daily if needed. May consider a lower starting dose in patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients receiving concomitant diuretics, especially those with renal impairment).
 
Child: 6 to 16 yr: 20-35 kg: 10 mg once daily, may increase to maximum of 20 mg once daily. >35 kg: 20 mg once daily, may increase to maximum of 40 mg once daily.

Elderly: May consider lower starting dose of 5-10 mg daily.

Contra-indication: Pregnancy (2nd and 3rd trimesters); biliary obstruction.

Side effects: Dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, nausea, chest pain, bronchitis, cough, pharyngitis, rhinitis, arthritis, back pain, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, peripheral oedema, haematuria, UTI, hyperkalaemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricaemia, elevated liver enzymes, facial edema, angioedema, and rhabdomyolysis.
Potentially Fatal: Acute renal failure.

Precaution: Drugs that act on renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal injury and death when used in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Olmesartan medoxomil should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. May be associated with oliguria, progressive azotaemia, and acute renal failure (rare). Patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis may have increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. Caution in renal impairment; monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels periodically. Avoid use in severe renal impairment (CrCl< 20 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment. Caution in patients with aortic or mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with primary aldosteronism may not respond to angiotensin receptor antagonist. Not recommended in lactation.

Mode of action: Amlodipine relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the slow channels or select voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It also increases myocardial oxygen delivery in patients w/ vasospastic angina.
Olmesartan is a selective and competitive angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist that blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. As a result, olmesartan relaxes blood vessels, hence lowering BP and increases blood supply and oxygen to the heart.

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: Additive effect when used with catecholamine depleting drugs; monitor for hypotension and/or marked bradycardia. If used with clonidine, clonidine withdrawal should occur a few days after withdrawal of the beta-blocker to prevent rebound hypertension; if replacing clonidine by beta-blocker, beta-blocker should be introduced only after clonidine administration has stopped for several days. Concurrent use with prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs (e.g. indomethacin) may reduce the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.
	Increased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ ACE inhibitors, K-sparing diuretics, K salts or K supplements and drugs that may increase serum K (e.g. ciclosporin, eplerenone). May potentiate BP lowering effects w/ other antihypertensives. May decrease glomerular filtration w/ NSAIDs which can cause acute renal failure. May increase serum concentrations and toxicity of lithium.Pharmasia Ltd.	Cardotel TAB dr   30's pack 240 BDT

	Indication: Angina, Hyperlipidaemia, Hypertension, Stroke prevention

Dose: Adult: PO HTN or angina and hyperlipidaemia: 

 Amlodipine: Initially 5 mg once daily, titrate over 1-2 wk; max: 10 mg/day. Atorvastatin: Initially 10-20 mg once daily (anytime of the day), patients who require >45 % reduction in LDL cholesterol may be initiated at 40 mg once daily. Titrate dose at intervals of at least 4 week; max: 80 mg/day.

Contra-indication: Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevated hepatic transaminases. Pregnancy and lactation.

Side effects: Amlodipine: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, peripheral oedema, flushing, palpitations, nausea, abdominal pain; rarely pruritus, rash, dyspnoea, asthenia and muscle cramps. Atorvastatin: Nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhoea, pain in extremity, UTI, dyspepsia, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasms, myalgia, insomnia, increased transaminases, abnormal liver function test, increased creatinine phosphokinase, thrombocytopenia, malaise, hepatitis, cholestasis, bullous rashes.
Potentially Fatal: Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.

Precaution: Atorvastatin may cause myopathy, and rarely rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria especially at high doses or in patients with history of renal impairment. Caution when used with CYP3A4 inhibitors which may increase plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin. Withhold/discontinue Atorvastatin if symptoms suggestive of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis are observed. Atorvastatin has been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver; LFT should be monitored prior to and at 12 wk following treatment initiation and dosage increment; caution in patients who consume large amounts of alcohol or with history of liver disease. Worsening of angina and/or myocardial infarction has been reported with use of dihydrophyridine calcium channel blockers, especially in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. Amlodipine may cause dose-dependent peripheral oedema. Caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Elderly.

Mode of action: Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker which relaxes peripheral and coronary vascular smooth muscle. It produces coronary vasodilation by inhibiting the entry of Ca ions into the voltage-sensitive channels of the vascular smooth muscle and myocardium during depolarisation. It reduces peripheral vascular resistance and hence resulting in a reduction of blood pressure. In vasospastic angina, Amlodipine also inhibits coronary spasm in patients with vasopastic angina. Atorvastatin selectively and competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate which is a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Rifamycins may increase the metabolism of both Amlodipine and Atorvastatin. Atorvastatin may increase AUC of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
Potentially Fatal: Atorvastatin: Increased risk of myopathy when used concurrently with fibric acid derivatives, lipid-modifying doses of niacin, cyclosporine or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, itraconazole). Cyclosporine (OATP1B1 inhibitor) may significantly increase bioavailability of Atorvastatin.ACI	Avlomox Paediatric Drops 125mg/1.2ml 15ml bot 30.29 BDT

Precaution:  Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy, including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.

Mode of action: Lamsoprazole: Proton pump inhibitor; binds to H+/K+-exchanging ATPase (proton pump) in gastric parietal cells resulting in blocking acid secretion.

Amoxicillin: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to one or more penicillin binding proteins that in turn inhibit the final transpeptidation step of peptoglycan synthesis in cell wall biosynthesis.

Clarithromycin: Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 50S ribosomal subunit causing antibacterial activity.

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: Amoxicillin: May reduce the efficacy of OC. May increase the effect of anticoagulants. Increased risk of allergic reactions w/ allopurinol. Increased and prolonged blood levels w/ probenecid. Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides and tetracyclines may interfere w/ the bactericidal effect of amoxicillin.

Clarithromycin: Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking Clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; and hypotension and acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine). Most reports of acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 involved elderly patients 65 years of age or older.

Lansoprazole: Increased risk of hypomagnesaemia w/ diuretics and digoxin. May decrease plasma concentration of erlotinib, dasatinib and lapatinib.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Efficacy decreased by oestrogens. Plasma concentrations decreased by tamoxifen.Indication: Diarrhea, Gastro-enteritis with dehydration

Dose: For oral administration only.
Reconstitution: The powder contents of one sachet or two effervescent tablets should be made up to 200ml with fresh drinking water. (For infants, the water should be freshly boiled and cooled before mixing with Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula). An infant's feeding bottle is a convenient measure of this volume. The solution should be made up immediately prior to feeding and any solution remaining an hour after reconstitution should be discarded. However, the solution may be used for up to 24 hours if stored in a refrigerator immediately after reconstitution. The reconstituted solution must not be boiled.

Contra-indication: There are no known contraindications to Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula. However, there may be a number of conditions where treatment with Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula will be inappropriate, e.g. intestinal obstruction requiring surgical intervention.

Side effects: None reported.

Precaution: Use water ONLY to mix Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula powder or effervescent tablets. Never dilute with lemonade, soft drinks, cordials or any other fluid than water.
Gastrolyte Electrolyte Rehydration Formula powder is available with either sodium saccharin or aspartame as a sweetening agent. Phenylketonurics are warned that this product, in some forms, contains phenylalanine. Please refer to the packaging for information relating to the sweetening agent used.
For oral administration only. The contents of one sachet or two effervescent tablets should always be made up to 200ml with water (the product must not be reconstituted in diluents other than water, e.g. must not be included in milk solutions). A weaker solution than recommended will fail to provide adequate sugar and electrolytes and a stronger solution than recommended may give rise to hypernatraemia. Intravenous rehydration is required for dehydrated children with shock, very large stool losses (>10mL/kg/hour), severe vomiting that interferes with oral fluid replacement, or glucose malabsorption. Patients with gastroenteritis should be monitored carefully to ensure that their condition does not deteriorate. In particular, young infants may become severely dehydrated in a short time.
Patients and/or parents should be advised to seek medical advice if the condition worsens. Clinicians should particularly ensure patients are aware of the risk of dehydration in young children and infants. Early warning signs of impending dehydration should be discussed.
Seek medical advice if diarrhoea persists for more than 6 hours in infants under 6 months, 12 hours in children aged 6 months to 3 years, 24 hours in children aged 3 to 6 years and 48 hours in children over 6 years of age.

Mode of action: Glucose is the end product of carbohydrate metabolism and is the chief source of energy for all cellular activities.
Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion.
Potassium citrate is absorbed and metabolized to potassium bicarbonate and this acts as a systemic alkalizer .

	Indication: Diarrhea,Gastro-enteritis with dehydration,Prolonged vomiting,Burns with a gastric fistula,Pulmonary hemorrhage,Intestinal bleeding

Dose: Children less than 2 years: After each loose stool or vomiting 10 to 20 spoonful (50-100 ml).
Children 2 to 10 years: After each loose stool or vomiting 100-200 ml of prepared oral saline.
Adult and children above 10 years: After each loose stool or vomiting 200-400 ml of prepared saline.

Contra-indication: None known.

Side effects: 

Precaution: Depressed renal function, severe continuing diarrhoea or other critical fluid losses may need supplementation with parenteral fluids along with oral saline.

Solutions containing acetate or gluconate ions should be used with caution, as excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.



Mode of action: Oral rehydration salts are given orally to prevent or treat dehydration due to acute diarrhoea. Essential water and salts are lost in stools and vomitus, and dehydration results when blood volume is decreased because of fluid loss from the extracellular fluid compartment. Preservation of the facilitated glucose-sodium cotransport system in the small-bowel mucosa is the rationale of oral rehydration therapy. Glucose is actively absorbed in the normal intestine and carries sodium with it in about an equimolar ration. Therefore, there is a greater net absorption of an isotonic salt solution with glucose than one without it. Potassium replacement during acute diarrhoea prevents below-normal serum concentrations of potassium, especially in children, in whom stool potassium losses are higher than in adults. Bicarbonates are effective in correcting the metabolic acidosis caused by diarrhoea and dehydration.

Dose: Minor hemorrhage:( Early joint or muscle bleed,Severe epistaxis)
Loading dose 15 IU FVIII:C/kg to achieve a FVIII:C plasma level of approximately 30% of normal; one infusion may be sufficient. If needed, half of the loading dose may be given once or twice daily for 1-2 days.

Moderate hemorrhage:(Advanced joint or muscle bleed,Neck, tongue, or pharyngeal hematoma (without airway compromise), Tooth extraction, Severe abdominal pain )

Loading dose 25 IU FVIII:C/kg to achieve a FVIII:C plasma level of approximately 50% of normal, followed by 15 IU FVIII:C/kg every 8-12 hours for the first 1-2 days to maintain the FVIII:C plasma level at 30% of normal. Continue the same dose once or twice daily for up to 7 days or until adequate wound healing is achieved.

Life-threatening hemorrhage:(Major surgery, Gastrointestinal bleeding, Neck, tongue, or pharyngeal hematoma (with potential for airway compromise) , Intracranial, intraabdominal, or intrathoracic bleeding, Fractures)

Initially 40-50 IU FVIII:C/kg, followed by 20-25 IU FVIII:C/kg every 8 hours to maintain the FVIII:C plasma level at 80-100% of normal for 7 days. Continue the same dose once or twice daily for another 7 days to maintain the FVIII:C level at 30-50% of normal.


Contra-indication: In individuals who have had an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to antihemophilic factor or von Willebrand factor preparations.

Side effects: The most serious adverse reaction observed in patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII is anaphylaxis. Thromboembolic events have also been observed in patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII for the treatment of VWD . Reports of thromboembolic events in VWD patients with other thrombotic risk factors receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy have been obtained from spontaneous reports, published literature, and a European clinical study. In some cases, inhibitors to coagulation factors may occur. However, no inhibitor formation was observed in any of the clinical studies.

In patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII in clinical studies for treatment of VWD, the most commonly reported adverse reactions observed by >5% of subjects are allergic-anaphylactic reactions (including urticaria, chest tightness, rash, pruritus, and edema). For patients undergoing surgery, the most common adverse reactions are postoperative wound and injection-site bleeding, and epistaxis.

Precaution: 5.1 Thromboembolic Events (VWD Patients)

Thromboembolic events have been reported in VWD patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor/von Willebrand Factor Complex replacement therapy, especially in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis.3,4 Early reports indicate a higher incidence may occur in females. Endogenous high levels of FVIII have also been associated with thrombosis, but no causal relationship has been established. Exercise caution and consider antithrombotic measures in all at-risk VWD patients who are receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy.

5.2 Monitoring for Intravascular Hemolysis

This contains blood group isoagglutinins (anti-A and anti-B). When doses are very large or need to be repeated frequently (for example, when inhibitors are present or when pre- and post-surgical care is involved), monitor patients of blood groups A, B, and AB for signs of intravascular hemolysis and decreasing hematocrit values and treat appropriately.

5.3 Monitoring VWF:RCo and FVIII Levels

Monitor the VWF: RCo and FVIII levels of VWD patients receiving this medicine using standard coagulation tests, especially in cases of surgery. It is advisable to monitor trough VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels at least once a day in order to adjust the dosage of this as needed to avoid excessive accumulation of coagulation factors 


Mode of action: Factor VIII is required for clot formation and maintenance of haemostasis. It activates factor X in conjunction with activated factor IX. Activated factor X then converts prothrombin to thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and forms a stable clot with factor XIII. Factor VIII is used for replacement therapy in patients with haemophilia A.

<10	   Avoid use.
Hepatic impairment: Severe hepatic impairment: Avoid use.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to aspirin, NSAIDs or clopidogrel; active peptic ulceration; children <12 yr; patients with haemophilia or haemorrhagic disorders; gout; severe renal or hepatic impairment; lactation.

Side effects: Aspirin: GI disturbances, epigastric discomfort, prolonged bleeding time, rhinitis, urticaria; angioedema, salicylism, tinnitus. Clopidogrel: Dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, constipation, gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers. Serious events include bleeding and GI haemorrhage. GI upset, diarrhoea, paraesthesia, vertigo, headache, dizziness, leucopaenia, eosinophilia, rash and pruritus.
Potentially Fatal: Aspirin: Gastric erosion, ulceration and bleeding; severe, occasionally fatal exacerbation of airway obstruction in asthma; Reye's syndrome (childn <12 yrs). Hepatotoxicity; CNS depression, which may lead to coma; CV collapse, resp failure; paroxysmal bronchospasm and dyspnoea. Clopidogrel: Bleeding disorders including GI intracranial haemorrhage and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Precaution: History of peptic ulcer or those prone to dyspepsia and those with gastric mucosal lesion or heavy ethanol consumption; asthma or allergic disorders; tinnitus; dehydrated patients; uncontrolled hypertension; impaired renal or hepatic function; children and elderly; pregnancy. Patients at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery, or other pathological conditions. Increased risk of Reye's syndrome when used in patients with chicken pox, influenza or flu symptoms. Caution when used in patients with nasal allergies or nasal polyps. For patients undergoing elective surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not needed, clopidogrel should be discontinued 7-10 days before surgery.

Mode of action: Aspirin inhibits the formation of thromboxane A2 in the platelets. This inhibits platelet aggregation and coagulation. This action lasts until the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase is regenerated in the platelets. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolised an active thiol metabolite. The active metabolite selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GP IIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.

Pregnancy category: A

Contra-indication: Astaxanthin is contraindicated in those hypersensitive to any component of an Astaxanthin containing supplement.

Side effects: Astaxanthin is safe when it is consumed in amounts found in food. The safety of using astaxanthin supplements and astaxanthin in skin products is unknown.

Precaution: Pregnant women and nursing mothers should avoid Astaxanthin containing supplements.

Mode of action: Astaxanthin is a xanthophyll carotenoid. It is an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties and as such has potential as a therapeutic agent in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Similar in structure to beta-carotene, this antioxidant also helps living organisms to quench, scavenge and trap free radicals inside its structure. Not only can it trap these harmful toxins effectively, it also has the ability to trap more types of radicals, such as singlet and triplet oxygen. Typically, a substance will lose an electron (a process that destabilizes the substance), when going through a metabolic process. Instead of sacrificing an electron, astaxanthin stabilizes these metabolic toxins radicals by simply adding them to its own double-bonded chain.

It also aids in preventing lipid peroxidation, as well as enhances the protective capacities of other antioxidants in the body. Astaxanthin has the ability to stop and reverse oxidative damage to both the totality of a cell’s structures, as well as healthy forms of cholesterol.

Precaution: Bronchospastic disease, renal or hepatic impairment, elderly. May aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorder. Beta-blocker can depress myocardial contractility; continued use in patients without history of cardiac failure may in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Caution in patients receiving anaesthetic agents that may depress myocardium. In patients with coronary artery disease, abrupt withdrawal may cause angina pectoris exacerbation, MI. Atenolol may mask signs (tachycardia) of hypoglycaemia and thyrotoxicosis. Latent DM may manifest with Chlorthalidone therapy. Chlorthalidone can cause hyperuricaemia and precipitate gout. Monitor renal functions, potassium levels, and signs of fluid and electrolytes imbalance. Discontinue if progressive renal impairment is evident. Not recommended in pregnancy and lactation. Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients have not been established.

Mode of action: Atenolol is a ?-blocker that acts preferentially on the ?1 adrenergic receptors in the heart. Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic that reduces BP possibly by inhibiting sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the distal convulated tubule. Combination of the two drugs results in additive antihypertensive action.

Pregnancy category: D

Withdraw gradually in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Adjustment in diabetic control may be required; may mask signs of thyrotoxicosis and modifies tachycardia of hypoglycaemia. Family history of psoriasis.

Mode of action: Atenolol is a beta 1-selective adrenergic receptor blocker. It has marked -ve inotropic and chronotropic effects which result in reduction of BP (particularly during exercise), myocardial oxygen demand and cardiac output. Nifedipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker. It is a coronary and peripheral vasodilator, which reduces BP and peripheral resistance, and increases myocardial oxygen demand.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Potentiate effects of other antihypertensives. Atenolol: Reduced hypotensive effect with pseudoephedrine, xylometazoline or NSAIDs. Additive effect with calcium antagonist and catecholamine-depleting drugs e.g. reserpine. Increase risk of bradycardia with amisulpride, flecainide, digitalis glycosides. Increase risk of hypotension with alprostadil, baclofen. Withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving ?-blockers may result in rebound hypertension.

	Indication:  Primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial), Mixed Dyslipidemia, Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, Hypertriglyceridemia, Familial hypercholesterolemia, Cardiovascular event prevention, Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia

Dose: Oral
Mixed dyslipidaemia, Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, Nonfamilial hypercholesterolaemia
Adult: Initially, 10 or 20 mg once daily, may be adjusted at 4-wk interval. May initiate 40 mg once daily in patients who require >45% reduction in LDL-cholesterol. Max: 80 mg/day.

Child: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: 10-17 yr 10 mg once daily, may increase at intervals of at least 4 wk to max 20 mg/day.
Elderly: No dosage adjustment needed.

Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. Therapy should be individualized according to goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of Atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the LDL-C levels should be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should total-C be used to monitor therapy. 

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage of Atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (eg, LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. 

Dosage in Patients with Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary. 

Pediatric Use: Treatment experience in a pediatric population is limited to doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day for 1 year in 8 patients with homozygous FH. No clinical or biochemical abnormalities were reported in these patients. None of these patients was below 9 years of age. 

Geriatric Use: Treatment experience in adult’s age 70 years with doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day has been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of Atorvastatin in this population were similar to those of patients <70 years of age.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity, active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminase, porphyria, pregnancy, lactation.

Side effects: Headache, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, xerostomia, angioedema, myalgia, rash/pruritus, alopecia, allergy, infection, chest pain.Potentially Fatal: Thrombocytopenia. Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.

Precaution: Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. History of liver disease. Patients with risk factors for myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Hypothyroidism should be properly managed prior to starting statin therapy. Children <10 yr. Premenarcheal females.

Mode of action: Atorvastatin competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. This results in the induction of the LDL receptors and stimulation of LDL catabolism, leading to lowered LDL-cholesterol levels.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: May increase risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis w/ CYP3A4 potent inhibitor (e.g. HIV or HCV protease inhibitors, itraconazole, clarithromycin), fenofibrate, colchicines, fixed combination of lopinavir/ritonavir. May decrease plasma concentration w/ CYP3A4 inducer (e.g. rifampicin, efavirenz). May significantly increase AUC and peak plasma concentration of digoxin. Increased AUC for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
Potentially Fatal: Increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis w/ ciclosporin, gemfibrozil, telaprevir, tipranavir.Chemist Ltd.	Atrium Injection 25mg/2.5ml 2.5 ml amp x 5's pack 400 BDT

Adult: Initially, 300-600 mcg/kg as inj. Subsequently, 100-200 mcg/kg when necessary or every 15-25 minutes for maintenance in prolonged procedures. Alternatively, maintenance can also be achieved by continuous infusion at 5-10 mcg/kg/minute. Initial dose should be given over 60 seconds in patients with CV disease. Dose should be calculated based on ideal body-weight in obese patients.

Child: >2 mth: Initially, 400-500 mcg/kg as inj. Maintenance dose: 80-100 mcg/kg; first maintenance dose may be given 20-45 min after the initial dose, subsequently, may be repeated every 15-25 min. 

For children 1 mth-2 yr: 300-400 mcg/kg may be used as initial dose in those who are under halothane anaesthesia. Maintenance doses may be admin more frequently in infant and children than adults.

Special Populations: For patients with significant CV disease or any history (e.g. severe anaphylactoid reactions or asthma) suggesting a greater risk of histamine release, an initial dose of 0.3-0.4 mg/kg should be given slowly or in divided doses over 1 min. For adults receiving atracurium following the use of succinylcholine for intubation under balanced anesthesia, an initial dose of 0.3-0.4 mg/kg is recommended. Dosage reductions may be necessary in patients with neuromuscular disease, severe electrolyte disorders or carcinomatosis in which potentiation of neuromuscular block or difficulties with reversal have been demonstrated.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Cutaneous reactions; bradycardia, transient hypotension in patients with CVS disorders; dyspnoea, bronchospasm; rash and urticaria.

Precaution: Neonates; severe CVS disorders; renal or hepatic dysfunction; myasthenia gravis and other neuromuscular disorders; severe electrolyte imbalances; respiratory insufficiency or pulmonary disease, asthma; burns; cardiopulmonary bypass; smoking; pregnancy and lactation. Dosage for obese patients should be based on ideal body-weight to prevent overdosing.

Mode of action: Atracurium besilate blocks neural transmission at the neuromuscular junction by competitive binding at the cholinergic receptor sites on the motor end plate.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:  Mixed block with suxamethonium which is difficult to reverse with anticholinergic drugs. Ketamine may potentiate the effects of atracurium. Concurrent use with tamoxifen or danazol may prolong effects of atracurium.

	Indication: Sunblock, Solar urticaria, Acute solar dermatitis, Acute lupus erythematosus, Herpes simplex, Polymorphic light eruption, Cutaneous albinism, Vitiligo, Drug-induced photosensitivity

Dose: Apply 45 minutes before swimming or sweat producing exercise. A single application may give day-long protection but the product should be re-applied during prolonged periods of sunning and after swimming or excessive sweating.

Contra-indication: The drug is contraindicated in individuals with a history of sensitivity reactions to any of the components of the preparation.

Side effects: Signs of irritations (including erythema, burning or rash) may appear when applied to sensitive or broken skin.

Precaution: Application to broken skin should be avoided. Contact with the eyes and other mucous membranes should be avoided.

Mode of action: 
Oxybenzone
Although benzophenones are primarily UV-B absorbers, oxybenzone absorbs well through UV-A II. Oxybenzone can be considered a broad-spectrum absorber. It significantly augments UV-B protection when used in a given formula. 
Avobenzone
Often referred to by its trade name, Parsol 1789, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane or avobenzone provides superior protection through a large portion of the UV-A range, including UV-A I. A significant addition to sunscreen products for true broad-spectrum UV protection, concerns have been raised regarding its photostability and its potential to degrade other sunscreen ingredients in products in which it is used. 
Titanium dioxide
The ideal sunscreen agent would be chemically inert, safe, and absorb or reflect through the full UV spectrum. Titanium dioxide meets these criteria limited only by aesthetics. By decreasing the particle size of this pigment to microsize or ultrafine grades, thereby making it less visible on the skin surface, some of these advantages could be used. This ingredient can be classified as a broad-spectrum agent. 
Padimate O
Padimate O is the most potent UV-B absorber.

Monitor LFT periodically; discontinue treatment if jaundice occurs. Reduce dose promptly or withdraw drug temporary if there is rapid decrease/persistently low WBC or signs of bone marrow depression. Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with reduced TPMT (thiopurine methyltransferase) activity.

Mode of action: Azathioprine is an imidazolyl derivative of mercaptopurine, which inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis and antagonises purine synthesis. It also inhibits mitosis and interferes with cellular metabolism of susceptible organisms. Azathioprine inj should be converted to oral therapy as soon as the drug can be tolerated.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Increased risk of haematotoxicity with aminosalicylates, drugs that affect myelopoesis e.g. co-trimoxazole or trimethoprim.

Dose to be given via intradermal inj. 

Intravesical
Immunotherapy of bladder cancer
Dosage: The content of 1 vial is required for 1 bladder instillation.
Duration: A standard treatment schedule consists of 1 intravesical instillation of BCG-Medac per week for 6 consecutive weeks as induction therapy. BCG treatment must not start until 2-3 weeks after transurethral resection (TUR). After a treatment-free interval of 4 weeks, intravesical administration should continue using maintenance therapy for at least 1 year. 

Induction Therapy (Prophylactic Treatment of Recurrence): BCG therapy should begin about 2-3 weeks after TUR or bladder biopsy, and without traumatic catheterisation, and be repeated at weekly intervals for 6 weeks. In intermediate and high-risk tumours, this should be followed by maintenance therapy.

Maintenance Therapy: One schedule consists of a 12-month therapy with treatments at monthly intervals. Another maintenance scheme consists of 3 instillations at weekly intervals at month 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36. In this scheme, a total of 27 instillations are administered during a period of 3 years.

Administration: BCG-Medac should be administered in the conditions required for intravesical endoscopy.  The bladder must be emptied before BCG instillation. BCG-Medac is introduced into the bladder by means of a catheter and at low pressure. 


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of BCG-Medac.
BCG-Medac should not be used in immunosuppressed patients or persons with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, whether due to concurrent disease (eg, positive HIV serology, leukaemia, lymphoma), cancer therapy (eg, cytostatic drugs, radiation) or immunosuppressive therapy (eg, corticosteroids).
BCG-Medac should not be administered to persons with active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis should be ruled out in individuals by anamnesis.
Past history of radiotherapy of the bladder.
BCG-Medac must not be instilled before 2-3 weeks after a TUR, a bladder biopsy or a traumatic catheterisation. Perforation of the bladder. Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) (see Precautions).
Use in lactation: There are no adequate data from the excretion of these bacteria in breastmilk. This treatment is contraindicated in nursing women.

Side effects: Side effects of BCG treatment are frequent but generally mild and transient. Adverse reactions usually increase with the number of BCG instillations.
In uncommon cases of arthritis/arthralgias, skin rash may occur. In most cases of arthritis, arthralgias and skin rash, these can be attributed to hypersensitivity reactions of the patient to BCG. It may be necessary in some cases to discontinue the administration of BCG-Medac.
Local Adverse Reactions: Discomfort and pain when urinating and frequent urination occur in up to 90% of the patients. The cystitis and inflammatory reaction (granulomata) may be an essential part of the antitumour activity.
Further local side effects which are uncommonly observed: Macroscopic haematuria, UTI, bladder retraction, urinary obstruction, bladder contracture, symptomatic granulomatous prostatitis, orchitis and epididymitis. Renal abscess is rarely observed. Furthermore, genital disorders (eg, vaginal pain, dyspareunia) may occur with an unknown frequency.
Transient Systemic BCG Reaction: Low grade fever, flu-like symptoms and general discomfort may occur. These symptoms usually subside within 24-48 hrs and should be managed by standard symptomatic treatment. These reactions are signs of a starting immune reaction. All patients receiving BCG-Medac should be carefully monitored and advised to report all incidences of fever and other events outside the urinary tract.
Severe Systemic Adverse Reactions/Infections: Systemic adverse reactions/infections are defined as: Fever >39.5°C during at least 12 hrs, fever >38.5°C during at least 48 hrs, miliary pneumonia due to BCG, granulomatous hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, organic dysfunction (other than genitourinary tract) with granulomatous inflammation at biopsy, Reiter's syndrome. Severe systemic BCG reaction/infection can lead to BCG sepsis which is a life-threatening situation.

Precaution: BCG-Medac may not be used for SC, intradermal, IM or IV administration or vaccination.
Treatment of Symptoms, Signs or Syndrome: See Adverse Reactions.
Number of BCG instillations: Side effects of BCG-treatment are frequent but generally mild and transient. Adverse reactions usually increase with the number of BCG instillations.
Severe Systemic BCG Infection/Reaction: Systemic BCG infections/reactions have been rarely reported and are described as fever >39.5°C during at least 12 hrs, fever >38.5°C during at least 48 hrs, miliary pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities, organic dysfunction (other than genitourinary tract) with granulomatous inflammation at biopsy. Reiter's syndrome. The possibility of severe systemic BCG infections has to be considered before starting the therapy.

Mode of action: Live BCG vaccine is an attenuated strain of bacillus Calmette-Guérin; used for active immunisation against tuberculosis. It is also used as an active immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder carcinoma in situ by causing a local, chronic inflammatory response involving macrophage and leukocyte infiltration of the bladder. This local inflammatory response results in destruction of superficial tumor cells of the urothelium.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Concurrent use with antimicrobials may interfere with efficacy of intravesicular BCG and suppress the immune response to BCG vaccination. Immune globulins may reduce the therapeutic effect of live organism vaccines. Increased risk of infections associated with vaccines (live organism) when used with immunosuppressants. Immune response of BCG vaccination may be compromised when used within 30 days of another live organism vaccine.Bio Pharma Ltd.	Nuba Plus Ointment   10gm  tube 30.11 BDT

	Indication: Minor cuts, Scrapes, Burns, Eczematoid dermatitis, Neurodermatitis, Eczema, Anogenital pruritus, Impetigo, Contact dermatitis, Bacterial skin infections

Dose: Apply the ointment in the affected eye every 3 or 4 hours, depending on the severity of the condition. Not more than 8 grams should be prescribed initially and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in precaution above.

Contra-indication: Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate ophthalmic ointment is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including: epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate ophthalmic ointment is also contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components. Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components.

Side effects: Adverse reactions have occurred with corticosteroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the corticosteroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. The exact incidence is not known. Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredient are allergic sensitization reactions including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . 

More serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. The reactions due to the corticosteroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.

Secondary Infection: The development of the secondary ocular infection has occurred after use of combinations containing corticosteroids and antimicrobials. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of a corticosteroid. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where corticosteroid treatment has been used . Local irritation on installation has been reported.

Precaution:  The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 8 grams should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. 

As fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term corticosteroid applications, fungal invasion should be suspected in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. 

There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of topical ophthalmic products in multiple-dose containers which have been inadvertently contaminated by patients, most of whom had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. 

Allergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.

Mode of action: Neomycin, an aminoglyoside with antimicrobial spectrum similar to gentamicin, binds to the 30S subunits of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and thereby disrupting DNA synthesis. It is active against many gram-negative aerobes and against some strains of staphylococci. 
Bacitracin, on the other hand, inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and is active against many gram-positive bacteria (e.g. staphylococci, streptococci, corynebacteria and clostridia) and some gram-negative species (e.g. Neisseria and Haemophilus influenzae). They are often found in combinations in topical preparations as broad spectrum antibacterial agents.
Polymyxin B disrupts the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane of mostly gm-ve organisms allowing leakage of intracellular constituents by binding to membrane phospholipids.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Bacitracin Zinc: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity when used with other nephrotoxic drugs. May enhance the action of neuromuscular-blocking agents.

Neomycin Sulphate: Additive nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effect w/ other aminoglycosides (e.g. paromomycin), bacitracin, cisplatin, vancomycin, amphotericin B, polymyxin B, colistin and viomycin.

May reduce the efficacy of OCs. May enhance the effect of acarbose. May enhance the effect of non-depolarising muscle relaxants. May antagonise the parasympathomimetic effect of neostigmine and pyridostigmine. May increase the risk of hypocalcaemia in patients receiving bisphosphonates. May alter INR when given w/ anticoagulants. May inactivate oral typhoid vaccine.

Polymixin B: Potentially Fatal: Additive neurotoxic or nephrotoxic effect w/ bacitracin, streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, cephaloridine, paromomycin, viomycin, colistin.

	Indication: X-ray imaging,Diagnostic procedures,Imaging of the GI tract

Dose: It  will depend on the degree and extent of contrast required in the area(s) under examination and on the equipment and technique employed.

Contra-indication: This product should not be used in patients with known gastric or intestinal perforation or hypersensitivity to barium sulfate products.

Side effects: Adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping, accompanying the use of barium sulfate formulations are infrequent and usually mild. Severe reactions (approximately 1 in 1,000,000) and fatalities (approximately 1 in 10,000,000) have occurred. Procedural complications are rare, but may include aspiration pneumonitis, barium sulfate impaction, granuloma formation, intravasation, embolization and peritonitis following intestinal perforation, vasovagal and syncopal episodes, and fatalities. It is of the utmost importance to be completely prepared to treat any such occurrence.

Precaution: Diagnostic procedures which involve the use of radiopaque contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel with the requisite training and with a thorough knowledge of the particular procedure to be performed. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, as evidenced by hay fever and eczema, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent, warrant special attention. Caution should be exercised with the use of radiopaque media in severely debilitated patients and in those with marked hypertension or advanced cardiac disease.

Ingestion of this product is not recommended in patients with a history of food aspiration. If barium studies are required in these patients or in patients in whom integrity of the swallowing mechanism is unknown, proceed with caution. If this product is aspirated into the larynx, further administration should be immediately discontinued.

After any barium study of the GI tract, it is important to rehydrate the patient as quickly as possible to prevent impaction of the bowel by barium sulfate. To prevent barium sulfate impaction in the bowel, the use of mild laxatives such as milk of magnesia or lactulose, following completion of the examination may also be required. These mild laxatives are recommended on a routine basis and in patients with a history of constipation unless contraindicated.

Use with caution in patients with complete or nearly complete obstruction of the GI tract.

Dose: Gently massage sufficient Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream into the affected skin areas twice a day, in the morning and evening.

Contra-indication: Patients who are sensitive to clotrimazole, betamethasone dipropionate, other corticosteroids or imidazoles, or to any ingredient in these preparations.

Side effects: Adverse reactions reported for Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream in clinical trials were paresthesia in 1.9% of patients, and rash, edema, and secondary infection, each in less than 1% of patients.

The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids and may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings. 
In the pediatric population, reported adverse events for Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream include growth retardation, benign intracranial hypertension, Cushing's syndrome (HPA axis suppression), and local cutaneous reactions, including skin atrophy.

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.

Adverse reactions reported with the use of clotrimazole are as follows: erythema, stinging, blistering, peeling, edema, pruritus, urticaria, and general irritation of the skin.

Precaution: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.

Conditions which augment systemic absorption include use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and use under occlusive dressings. 

If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios 

Mode of action: Betamethasone is a corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity.

Hemorrhage

    Fatal pulmonary hemorrhage can occur in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy and bevacizumab
    Do not administer the drug to patients with recent hemoptysis (at least 2.5 mL of red blood)


Mode of action: Bevacizumab binds to VEGF, the key driver of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, and thereby inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), on the surface of endothelial cells.
Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF reduces the vascularisation of tumours, normalises remaining tumour vasculature and inhibits the formation of new tumour vasculature thereby inhibiting tumour growth.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Irinotecan/5–fluorouracil/leucovorin
The incidence of epistaxis and grade 1 or 2 hemorrhage (including GI hemorrhage, minor gum bleeding, vaginal hemorrhage) was greater in patients receiving bevacizumab plus irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin compared with patients receiving irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus placebo. Closely monitor the patient during coadministration.

Live vaccines
The administration of live vaccines to patients receiving bevacizumab may result in a reduced immune response. Avoid coadministration.

Dose: The appropriate dose of black seed depends on several factors such as the user's age, health, and several other conditions. At this time there is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for black seed. Keep in mind that natural products are not always necessarily safe and dosages can be important. Be sure to follow relevant directions on product labels and consult your pharmacist or physician or other healthcare professional before using.

Contra-indication: Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.

Side effects: Black seed, when used in small quantities, such as a flavoring for foods, appears to be safe for most people. There isn't enough information to know if larger, medicinal quantities are safe. Black seed can cause allergic rashes when applied to the skin. 

Precaution: Black seed seems to be safe in food amounts during pregnancy. But taking larger medicinal amounts is UNSAFE. Black seed can slow down or stop the uterus from contracting.

Dose: Adult Dosage:
Initiate treatment at 62.5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then increase to the maintenance dose of 125 mg twice daily. Doses above 125 mg twice daily did not appear to confer additional benefit sufficient to offset the increased risk of hepatotoxicity.

Bosentan should be administered in the morning and evening with or without food.

Contra-indication: Patients with WHO Class II symptoms showed reduction in the rate of clinical deterioration and a trend for improvement in walk distance. Physicians should consider whether these benefits are sufficient to offset the risk of hepatotoxicity in WHO Class II patients, which may preclude future use as their disease progresses.

Side effects: More common

    Blurred vision
    confusion
    dizziness
    dark urine
    faintness or lightheadedness when getting up from a lying or sitting position

Contra-indication: Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma. Hypersensitivity to Budesonide, Formoterol or to Lactose.

Side effects: The most common drug related adverse reactions are pharmacologically predictable side effects of beta 2-agonist therapy, such as tremor and palpitations. Adverse events which have been associated with Budesonide and Formoterol are Palpitations, Candida infections in oropharynx, Headache, Tremor, Coughing, Hoarseness and Tachycardia.

Precaution: Treatment with Budesonide and Formoterol combination should not be initiated to treat a severe exacerbation or if patients have significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. May produce paradoxical bronchospasm which is life-threatening. Caution when used in patients with CV diseases, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Chronic use may further decrease bone mineral content when used in patients with advanced age, osteoporosis, poor nutrition, sedentary lifestyle or tobacco use. May reduce growth velocity when used in paediatric patients. Caution when used in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract, untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Budesonide is a corticosteroid that has mainly glucocorticoid activity. It prevents and controls inflammation by controlling the rate of protein syntheis, decreasing the migration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes/fibroblasts and reversing capillary permeability. Formoterol fumarate is a selective ?2-adrenergic agonist. It causes bronchodilation by catalysing the conversion of adenosine triphosphate to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) resulting in bronchial smooth muscle relaxation.

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: Concomitant admin with CYP3A4 inhibitor e.g. itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin may inhibit the metabolism of budesonide. Concurrent use with nonpotassium-sparing diuretics may lead to ECG changes and/or hypokalaemia.ACI	Budenide Nasal Spray  100mcg/spray 120 sprays 250 BDT

Precaution: Active or doubtfully quiescent tuberculosis, paradoxical bronchospasm; children, elderly; pregnancy, lactation.

Mode of action: Budesonide is a corticosteroid that has mainly glucocorticoid activity. It prevents and controls inflammation by controlling the rate of protein syntheis, decreasing the migration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes/fibroblasts and reversing capillary permeability. 

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: The main route of metabolism of corticosteroids, including budesonide, is via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally administered budesonide increased. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, budesonide. Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of Budesonide Nasal Spray with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin).ACI	Conart TAB dr 1mg 30's pack 150.60 BDT

	Indication: Depression, smoking cessation

Dose: Oral
Smoking cessation
Adult: Modified-release preparation: Initially, 150 mg once daily for 6 days then increased to 150 mg bid. Period of treatment: 7-12 wk. To discontinue treatment if abstinence is not achieved by 7th wk. Max: 300 mg/day.
Elderly: 150 mg/day.

Depression
Adult: Initially, 100 mg bid increased to 100 mg tid after 3 days if necessary. Increased further to 150 mg tid if no improvement has been observed after several wk of therapy. Max: 150 mg tid. As a modified-release preparation: 150 mg once daily in the morning, increased to 150 mg bid after 3 days if necessary, may further increase to 200 mg bid after several wk if needed. Max: 450 mg as a single dose.

Contra-indication: It is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder. Bupropion Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients treated with other medications that contain Bupropion because the incidence of seizure is
dose dependent. Bupropion may induce seizure and consequently its use is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy. The drug is also contraindicated in patients with a current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or
anorexia nervosa because of a higher incidence of seizures noted in such patients treated for bulimia with Bupropion Hydrochloride. The concurrent administration of Bupropion Hydrochloride and
a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of MAO inhibitor and initiation of treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride. Bupropion Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown an allergic response to
Bupropion or the other ingredients that make up Bupropion Hydrochloride.

Side effects: Agitation, anxiety, and insomnia often occur during the initial stages of Bupropion therapy. Other relatively common side effects reported with Bupropion include fever, dry mouth, headache or migraine, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, tremor, sweating, and skin rashes.
Hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from pruritus and urticaria, less commonly, angio-oedema, dyspnoea, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.

Precaution: It should be used with extreme caution, in patients with history of seizure disorders or in patients with other predisposing factors such as severe hepatic cirrhosis or a CNS tumour, and in those undergoing abrupt withdrawal from alcohol or Benzodiazepines. The use of Bupropion in patients with other risk factors for seizures (for example, alcohol abuse, a history of head trauma, diabetes, and drugs known to lower the seizure threshold) should only be undertaken when there are compelling clinical
reasons. Bupropion should be used with caution in patients with bipolar depression or psychoses and in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease and in hepatic or renal
impairment. 

Mode of action: Bupropion HCl is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine, serotinin and dopamine. The mechanism by which it aids in smoking cessation is presumed to be mediated by its noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic actions.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Neuroleptics, lithium and TCAs, benzodiazepine, alcohol, drugs that lower seizure threshold. Increased risk of side effects when co-admin with levodopa. Reduced hepatic clearance with fluoxetine. Caution when administering with agents that will affect hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. Increased risk of toxicity when used with ritonavir.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAO inhibitors may cause acute toxicity symptoms and increased risk of fatality.Kumudini Pharma Ltd.	Busper TAB dr 10mg 30's pack 210 BDT

Max Dosage: 45 mg daily in divided doses.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity. Epilepsy; severe renal or hepatic impairment; children <18 yr; pregnancy, lactation.

Side effects: Dizziness, nausea, headache, nervousness, lightheadedness, excitement, paraesthesia, sleep disturbances, chest pain, tinnitus, nasal congestion, sore throat. Less sedation and lower potential for dependence compared to other anxiolytics.

Precaution: Preceding co-administration of MAOIs, decreased hepatic or renal function. In patients on benzodiazepines, withdraw the drug gradually. May impair ability to drive or operate machinery.

Mode of action: Buspirone exerts anxiolytic activity through high affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors. It has moderate affinity for dopamine D2-receptors but no affinity for GABA receptors.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Enhanced sedative effects with alcohol or CNS depressants. Increases serum haloperidol. Concurrent admin with MAOIs may lead to increase in BP.
Potentially Fatal: Elevation of BP when taken concomitantly with MAOIs.Excella, Germany	Myleran TAB dr 2mg 100's pack 1030 BDT

Precaution: Prior treatment with other myelosuppressive drugs, patients predisposed to seizures. May cause secondary malignancies (tumors, acute leukaemias, ovarian failure). Previous irradiation/therapy. Monitor blood counts carefully during therapy. Discontinue if lung toxicity develops.

Mode of action: Busulfan reacts with N-7 position of guanosine and interferes with DNA replication and RNA transcription by alkylating and cross-linking the DNA strands.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction:  	Decreased clearance when used with cyclophosphamide and itraconazole. Increased clearance by phenytoin. May reduce response to vaccines, possibility of generalized infections with live vaccines. Combination with thioguanine results in oesophageal varices and abdominal liver function tests.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis
The recommended dosage is 0.25 mcg twice daily or 0.50 mcg once daily. Serum creatinine levels should be determined at 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months and 6 monthly intervals thereafter.

Renal osteodystrophy (Dialysis patients)
The recommended initial dose of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day. Patients with normal or only slightly reduced serum calcium levels may respond to Calcitriol doses of 0.25 mcg every other day. Most patients undergoing hemodialysis respond to doses between 0.5 and 1 mcg/day.

Hypoparathyroidism & Rickets
The recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day given in the morning. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased at 2 to 4 week intervals.

Predialysis patients:
The recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day in adults and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. This dosage may be increased if necessary to 0.5 mcg/day.
Child dose: 1 month - 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage of Calcitriol is 10 to 15 ng/kg/day.

Injection
The recommended intravenous initial dose of Calcitriol injection, depending on the severity of the hypocalcemia and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism, is 1 mcg (0.02 mcg/kg) to 2 mcg administered three times weekly, approximately every other day. Doses as small as 0.5 mcg and as large as 4 mcg three times weekly have been used as an initial dose. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 1 mcg at two to four week intervals. 

Contra-indication: Hypercalcaemia; evidence of vitamin D toxicity. Pregnancy (dose exceeding RDA). Lactation.

Side effects: Adverse events associated with Calcitriol therapy are similar to those encountered with excess vitamin D intake, i.e. hypercalcemia syndrome, or calcium intoxication.

	Indication: Postmenopausal osteoporosis, Osteoporosis, Osteomalacia/rickets, Hypoparathyroidism, Latent tetany, Hypocalcaemia, Calcium and vitamin D deficiency

Dose: Adult: PO Per tab contains Ca carbonate 1,500 mg and vitamin D3 10 mcg: 1 tab twice daily.

Contra-indication: Patients with hypercalcaemia and/or hypercalciuria. Nephrolithiasis, hypervitaminosis D, hypophosphataemia.

Side effects: Constipation, flatulence, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, pruritus, rash and urticaria.

Precaution: Impaired calcium absorption in achlorhydria which is common in elderly. Increased risk of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria in hypoparathyroid patients receiving high doses of vitamin D. Caution when using in patients with history of kidney stones. Renal impairment; frequent monitoring of serum calcium and phosphorus is recommended.

Mode of action: Calcium /vitamin D3 prevents or treats negative Ca balance. It also helps facilitate nerve and muscle performance as well as normal cardiac function. Bone mineral component; cofoactor in enzymatic reactions, essential for neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and many signal transduction pathways. Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble sterol. It is necessary for the regulation and regulation of calcium and phosphate homoeostasis and bone mineralisation. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. Clinical studies also show that Calcium and Vitamin D has synergistic effects on bone growth as well as in Osteoporosis and fracture prevention.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: May affect the absorption of tetracycline when used together. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may reduce calcium absorption. Thiazide diuretics may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Concurrent use with ion-exchange resins may reduce GI absorption of vitamin D. Hypercalcaemia may increase the toxicity of cardiac glycosides during treatment with calcium and vitamin D, monitor ECG and serum calcium levels. Bisphosphonate or sodium fluoride should be given at least 3 hr before calcium-containing preparations.Square	Calbo-D Vita TAB dr 600 mg + 400 IU  150 BDT
	Indication: Calcium and vitamin D deficiency, Calcium and vitamin D supplement, Osteoporosis.

Dose: 1 -2 tablets per day, preferably one tablet each morning and evening or as directed by the physician


Contra-indication: Hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism
Hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis
Hypersensitivity to the component of this preparation
Severe renal insufficiencies

Side effects: Orally administered Calcium Carbonate may be irritating to the GI tract. It may also cause constipation. Hypercalcemia is rarely produced by administration of Calcium alone, but may occur when large doses are given to patients with chronic renal failure. Also there may be allergic reactions, irregular heartbeats, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite dry mouth and drowsiness, skin rash.

Precaution: When hypercalcemia occurs discontinuation of the drug is usually sufficient to return serum calcium concentrations to normal. Calcium salts should be used cautiously in patients with sarcoidosis, renal or cardiac disease and in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. Patients with a history of stone formation should also be recommended to increase their fluid intake.

Popular	Hypophos TAB dr 667mg 60's pack 331.20 BDT
	Indication: Hyperphosphatemia

Dose: Adult: PO Initial: 3-4 g/day. Usual range: 6-12 g/day. Increase dose gradually according to serum phosphate conc, provided hypercalcaemia does not occur.

Contra-indication: Patients with hypercalcaemia. 

Side effects: GI irritations. Excessive amounts may lead to hypercalcaemia.

Precaution: Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Renal impairment, diseases associated with hypercalcaemia such as sarcoidosis & some malignancies. Avoid in patients with calcium renal calculi or a history of renal calculi.

Mode of action: Sequesters phosphate in the intestine by forming insoluble phosphates that are excreted faecally, thus reducing serum phosphate conc & secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Tetracycline antibiotics, thiazide diuretics, vit D, corticosteroids, bisphosphonates, fluoride, some fluoroquinolones.ACI	Acical 500 TAB dr 1250mg 100's pack 301 BDT

	Indication: Heartburn, Indigestion, Calcium deficiency, Hypocalcaemia, Hyperphosphatemia, Calcium supplement, Stomach upset

Dose: Adult: PO Hyperacidity: Take 1-2 tab as needed, up to a max of 16 tab/day. May suck or chew tablets. 

Hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure Initial: 2.5 g/day, up to 17 g/day in divided doses.

Renal impairment:
CrCl (ml/min)	
<25	Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on serum calcium levels. 

Contra-indication: Patients with Ca renal calculi or history of renal calculi; hypercalcaemia; hypophosphataemia. Patients with suspected digoxin toxicity.

Side effects: Constipation, flatulence; hypercalcaemia; metabolic alkalosis; milk-alkali syndrome, tissue-calcification. Gastric hypersecretion and acid rebound (with prolonged use).

Precaution: Renal impairment, hypoparathyroid disease, hypercalcaemia-associated diseases. Calcium absorption is impaired in achlorhydria; use an alternate salt and take with food. Caution when used in patients with a history of kidney stones.

Mode of action: Calcium carbonate can neutralise gastric acid rapidly and effectively. However, it may adversely activate Ca dependent processes, leading to secretion of gastric and hydrochloric acid. It can induce rebound acid secretion and, prolonged high doses may cause hypercalcemia, alkalosis and milk-alkali syndrome.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Co-administration with thiazide diuretics or vit D may lead to milk-alkali syndrome and hypercalcaemia. Decreased absorption with corticosteroids. Decreases absorption of tetracyclines, atenolol, iron, quinolones, alendronate, Na fluoride, Zn and calcium-channel blockers. Enhances cardiac effects of digitalis glycosides and may precipitate digitalis intoxication.ACI	Acical-C Eff TAB dr  1000mg+327mg+500mg 10's pack 110.30 BDT

Dose: Adults ?18 years: Recommended Dose: 100 mg PO once daily taken before the first meal of the day

May increase dose to 300 mg once daily in patients tolerating 100 mg/day who have an eGFR ?60 mL/min/1.73 m² and require additional glycemic control.

Renal impairment

    eGFR ?60 mL/min/1.73 m²: No dosage adjustment required
    eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m²: Do not exceed 100 mg/day
    eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m²: Do not initiate canagliflozin
    Discontinue if eGFR declines below 45 mL/min/1.73 m²


Contra-indication: History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction and hypersensitivity to canagliflozin.
Severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2), end stage renal disease or patients on dialysis.

Side effects: Female genital mycotic infections (10.4-11.4%)

Increased urination (4.6-5.3%)

Male genital mycotic infections (3.7-4.2%)

Vulvovaginal pruritus (1.6-3%)

Thirst (2.3-2.8%)

Constipation (1.8-2.3%)

Nausea (2.2-2.3%)

Abdominal pain (1.7-1.8%)

Volume depletion

Overall population (2.3-3.4%)
Age >75 yr (4.9-8.7%)
eGFR <60/mL/min/1.73 m³ (4.7-8.1%)
Use of loop diuretic (3.2-8.8%)



Precaution: Causes intravascular volume contraction and symptomatic hypotension can occur, particularly if eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²2, advance age, existing low systolic BP, or taking either diuretics or drugs that interfere with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) (eg, ACE inhibitors, ARBs).

Drug increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR, patients with hypovolemia are more susceptible to renal function impairment.

Hyperkalemia reported; patients with moderate renal impairment who take potassium-sparing diuretics or drugs that alter RAS are more likely to develop hyperkalemia.

Hypoglycemia risk increased with insulin and insulin secretagogues, adjust dose.

Genital mycotic infections may occur, patients with history of genital mycotic infections and uncircumcised males are more susceptible.

Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, generalized urticaria), some serious, were reported during clinical trials.

Dose-related increases in LDL-C reported.

No conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with canagliflozin or any other antidiabetic agent.

SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests; use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.

The FDA continues to investigate reports of ketoacidosis associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (ie, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin); monitor for signs of ketoacidosis and advise patients to seek immediate medical attention for symptoms (eg, difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepiness).

Increased risk of bone fracture, occurring as early as 12 weeks after treatment initiation, reported; consider factors that contribute to fracture risk prior to initiating therapy.

Higher risk of falls for patients treated within first few weeks of treatment reported.

Mode of action: SGLT-2 inhibition lowers the renal glucose threshold (ie, the plasma glucose concentration which exceed the maximum glucose reabsorption capacity of the kidney); lowering the renal glucose threshold results in increased urinary glucose excretion.

	Indication: Epilepsy,Schizophrenia,Bipolar disorder,Trigeminal neuralgia

Dose: Epilepsy: Adults and children over 12 years of age - Initial: Either 200 mg b.i.d. for tablets and XR tablets, or 1 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (400 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 200 mg/day using a b.i.d or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the either formulations until the optimal response is obtained. 

Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily in children 12-15 years of age, and 1200 mg daily in patients above 15 years of age. Doses up to 1600 mg daily have been used in adults in rare instances. 

Maintenance: usually 800-1200 mg daily. Children 6-12 years of age - Initial: Either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or XR tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension (200 mg/day). Increase at weekly intervals by adding up to 100 mg/day using a b.i.d. or a t.i.d. or q.i.d. regimen of the either formulations until the optimal response is obtained. Dosage generally should not exceed 1000 mg daily. Maintenance: usually 400-800 mg daily. 

Children under 6 years of age - Initial: 10-20 mg/kg/day b.i.d. or t.i.d. as tablets, or q.i.d. as suspension. Increase weekly to achieve optimal clinical response administered t.i.d. or q.i.d. Maintenance: Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of Carbamazepine for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made. 

Combination therapy: Carbamazepine may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased. 

Trigeminal Neuralgia: Initial: On the first day, either 100 mg b.i.d. for tablets or XR tablets, or 1/2 teaspoon q.i.d. for suspension, for a total daily dose of 200 mg. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day using increments of 100 mg every 12 hours for tablets or XR tablets, or 50 mg (1/2 teaspoon) q.i.d. for suspension, only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. A total dose of 1200 mg daily shouldn't be exceeded. 
Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400-800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as much as 1200 mg daily. At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level or even to discontinue the drug. The tablets or syrup can be taken without regards to meal.

	Indication: Parkinson's disease and 'end of dose' motor fluctuations 

Dose: Adult: PO  Initial: 1 tab/day. Titrate dose according to patient's response. Recommended to take only 1 tab per dose administration. Max: 8 tabs/day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity. Narrow angle glaucoma. Should not be used in patients with suspicious, undiagnosed skin lesions or a history ot melanoma.

Side effects: Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hallucinations, hyperpyrexia and confusion. Fibrotic complications. Dark colour (red, brown or black) may appear in bodily secretions such as sweat, saliva and urine. Possible increase in dyskinesia. Chest pain, asthenia, cardiac irregularities, angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, back pain, shoulder pain and muscle cramps.
Potentially Fatal: Rhabdomyolysis.

Precaution: Periodic monitoring of hepatic, renal, haematopoietic and CV functions in patients on prolonged therapy. Monitor for changes in IOP in patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma. Caution when used in patients with biliary obstruction. Caution when interpreting plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites. Withdrawal should be gradual.

Mode of action: Levodopa is the metabolic precurosor of dopamine, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa increases the amount of levodopa that is transported into the CNS by inhibiting the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Entacapone is a selective inhibitor of catechol-o-methyltransferase. Given concurrently, entacapone results in greater and more substained plasma levels of levodopa, leading to greater control of parkinsonism symptoms.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased risk of postural hypotension when used concurrently with hypotensive drugs. Severe orthostatic hypotension may result from concurrent usage with MAOIs. Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, phenytoin or papaverine may reduce the efficacy of levodopa. Iron salts may reduce the bioavailability. Concurrent usage with drugs that interfere with biliary excretion may lead to increased plasma levels of entacapone. May depress prolactin secretion and increase growth hormone levels.ACI	Cinemet CR Continued Release TAB dr 50 mg + 200 mg   BDT

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to Cefditoren, other cephalosporins; or milk proteins. Carnitine deficiency.

Side effects: Diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, vaginal moniliasis, dyspepsia, vomiting, haematuria, increased urine white blood cells, decreased haematocrit, increased glucose, interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, acute renal failure, arthralgia, thrombocytopenia, erythema multiforme. Pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment.
Potentially Fatal: Hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

Precaution: Pregnancy and lactation. Patients with penicillin allergy. Avoid prolonged use as pivalate-containing compounds may cause carnitine deficiency over time; greater risk of carnitine deficiency in patients with renal impairment or decreased muscle mass. May decrease prothrombin activity especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, poor nutritional status, prolonged antibiotic treatment or patients previously stabilised on anticoagulant therapy. Long term use may result in development of drug-resistant bacteria, or superinfection including Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis.

Mode of action: Cefditoren is a third generation cephalosporin used for treatment of susceptible infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Reduced oral bioavailability when coadministered with antacids or H2-receptor antagonists. Probenecid may increase plasma concentration and prolong half-life of Cefditoren. May enhance anticoagulant effect of vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin).ACI	Pime-4 IV/IM Injection 1gm/vial 1gm vial with water 553.73 BDT

Dose: Adult: PO Resp tract infections; UTI 100-200 mg 12 hrly. Skin infections 200-400 mg 12 hrly. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea 200 mg as a single dose.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Anaphylactic shock; purpuric nephritis, skin rash, pruritus; diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting.
Potentially Fatal: Pseudomembranous colitis; nephrotoxicity.

Precaution: History of allergy to penicillin; severe renal impairment; pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Cefpodoxime binds to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death.
Addition of clavulanate inhibits beta-lactamase-producing bacteria; Clavulanic acid has a high affinity for and binds to certain ?-lactamases that generally inactivate Cefpodoxime  by hydrolyzing its ?-lactam ring. Combining clavulanate potassium with Cefpodoxime  extends the antibacterial spectrum of Cefpodoxime  to include many bacteria normally resistant to Cefpodoxime  and other penicillins and cephalosporins.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Antacids or H2-blockers may decrease the absorption of cefpodoxime. Reduced renal excretion w/ probenecid.Apex	Zilcef TAB dr 250mg 8's pack  BDT

	Indication: Pneumonia, Meningitis, Acute otitis media, Lyme disease, Typhoid fever, Otitis media, Pelvic inflammatory disease, Septicemia, Skin and Skin-Structure Infections, Gonorrhea, Respiratory tract infections, Urinary tract infections, Bone and Joint Infections, Chlamydia infection, Surgical Prophylaxis

Dose: Adult: IV Typhoid fever 2 g once daily for 14 days. 
IV/IM Susceptible infections 1-2 g/day, up to 4 g/day for severe infections. 
Surgical prophylaxis 1 g as a single dose 0.5-2 hr pre-op. 
IM Uncomplicated gonorrhoea; Prevention of secondary meningococcal meningitis 250 mg as a single dose.

Children under 12 years: The recommended total daily dose is 50 to 75 mg/kg once daily (or twice daily in equally divided doses). In severe infections, up to 80 mg/kg body weight daily may be given. 

The total daily dose should not exceed 2 gm. In the treatment of meningitis, the initial dose of 100 mg/kg body weight (not to exceed 4 gm daily) once daily (or twice daily in equally divided doses), is recommended. 
As soon as the causative organism has been identified and its sensitivity, the doses can be reduced accordingly. The usual duration of therapy in meningitis is 7 to 14 days. 

Renal impairment:
CrCl (ml/min)	
<10	     Max: 2 g daily. 

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins; hyperbilirubinaemic neonates. Do not use calcium or calcium-containing solutions or products with or within 48 hr of ceftriaxone administration due to risk of calcium-ceftriaxone precipitate formation.

Side effects: History of penicillin allergy; severe renal impairment; pregnancy and lactation; superinfection.

Precaution: History of penicillin allergy; severe renal impairment; pregnancy and lactation; superinfection.

Mode of action: Ceftriaxone binds to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: May increase nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides. May diminish therapeutic effect of BCG, typhoid vaccine, Na picosulfate. May increase anticoagulant effect of vit K antagonists (e.g. warfarin). May increase serum level w/ probenecid.

Potentially Fatal: Admin w/ Ca-containing IV soln may cause precipitation of a crystalline material in the lungs and kidneys.ACI	Cerox A Powder for Suspension 125mg/5ml 70ml bot 198.75 BDT

Uncomplicated skin & skin-structure infections: 30 mg/kg/day in two divided doses 10 days
Uncomplicated urinary tract infection: 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses 7-10 days



Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.

Side effects: Large doses can cause cerebral irritation and convulsions; nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, GI disturbances; erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, epidermal necrolysis.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylaxis, nephrotoxicity, pseudomembranous colitis.

Precaution: Severe renal impairment; pregnancy, lactation; hypersensitivity to penicillins.

Mode of action: Cefuroxime binds to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death.

Addition of clavulanate inhibits beta-lactamase-producing bacteria; Clavulanic acid has a high affinity for and binds to certain ?-lactamases that generally inactivate Cefuroxime  by hydrolyzing its ?-lactam ring. Combining clavulanate potassium with Cefuroxime  extends the antibacterial spectrum of Cefuroxime  to include many bacteria normally resistant to Cefuroxime  and other penicillins and cephalosporins.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of strong-acting diuretics (e.g. furosemide) and aminoglycosides. May enhance the effect of oral anticoagulants. May reduce the efficacy of OCs.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.

Side effects: Pain at inj site; hypersensitivity; GI disturbances; eosinophilia, neutropenia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions; nephrotoxicity.

Precaution: Hypersensitivity to penicillins; pseudomembranous colitis; renal failure; pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Cefalexin binds to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Concurrent use w/ metfromin may result to fatal lactic acidosis. May enhance the anticoagulant effect of vit K antagonists (e.g. warfarin). Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ potent diuretics (e.g. ethacrynic acid, furosemide) and other potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics (e.g. aminoglycosides, polymyxin, colistin). Prothrombin time may be prolonged when used concomitantly w/ oral anticoagulants. May reduce the effects of OCs. Hypokalaemia may result from concomitant use of cefalexin and cytotoxic drugs for leukaemia. Uricosuric drugs (e.g. probenecid) may suppress renal excretion, resulting to increased plasma levels of cefalexin. May diminish the therapeutic effect of Na picosulfate, BCG and typhoid vaccine. May reduce serum level w/ multivitamins/minerals.ACI	Avlosef Paediatric Drops 125mg/1.2ml 15ml bot 50.19 BDT

Potentially Fatal: Pseudomembranous colitis.

Precaution: Renal impairment; history of penicillin sensitivity; pregnancy; lactation.

Mode of action: Cefradine is a 1st generation cephalosporin which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of the peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell wall by binding to one or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), thus arresting cell wall synthesis leading to bacterial cell death.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ loop diuretics. Decreased renal clearance w/ probenecid.Indication: Pulmonary embolism, Thromboembolism, Deep venous thrombosis

Potentially Fatal: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with or without thrombosis; bleeding.

Precaution: Monitor platelet counts. Discontinue treatment if thrombocytopenia occurs. Hypersensitivity, elderly, pregnancy.

Mode of action: Certoparin is a low molecular weight Heparin. Certoparin works by interfering with the body`s natural blood clotting mechanism. This mechanism involves a series of complex pathways. Certoparin inactivate thrombin, which plays an important role in blood clot formation. Therefore, Certoparin prevent the formation of blood clots in the body and breakdown pre-existing blood clots. Certoparin has many advantages over normal heparin. These include a more effective anticoagulant effect and reduced risk of bleeding.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Enhanced anticoagulant effect w/ other drugs affecting platelet function or the coagulation system (e.g. platelet aggregation inhibitors, thrombolytic agents, salicylates, NSAIDs, vit K antagonists, dextrans, activated protein C). Decreased anticoagulant effect w/ gyceryl trinitrate infusion. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists.General	Bongel Oral Gel   10gm tube 80 BDT

Precaution: Avoid eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth just after using this medicationAvoid contact w/ eyes. Do not inject or use in body cavities.

Mode of action: Chlorhexidine is a very potent cationic chemoprophylactic agent that has a broad-spectrum of activity against gm+ve and gm-ve bacteria. It is both bacteriostatic and bactericidal depending on its concentration. The bactericidal effect, which is achieved at high concentrations, is due to the binding of the cationic to negatively charged bacterial cell walls and extramicrobial complexes. Bacteriostatic effect is achieved at low concentrations which causes an alteration of bacterial cell osmotic equilibrium and leakage of potassium and phosphorus.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Soaps, other anionic agents, borates, bicarbonates, carbonates, chlorides, citrates, nitrates, phosphates & sulfates.Indication: Burns, Wound dressing for preventing excessive wound dryness and the prevention of infection in minor skin, Scalds abrasions, Lacerations, Crush injuries, Diabetic ulcers, Skin Grafting, Pressure sores, Colostomies, Surgical wounds

Dose: The dressing is for administration to adults, children and infants; it may be changed daily but frequency of application will depend upon the clinical circumstances. It is intended that the dressing be used principally on body wounds covering up to ten percent surface area. There is however no contraindication for use on larger area wounds.

Contra-indication: Should not be used in known cases of sensitivity or allergy to chlorhexidine

Side effects: Chlorhexidine is well tolerated topically with minimal absorption. Sensitivity reaction is extremely rare.

Precaution: Avoid contact with eyes, middle ear, meninges and brain
Do not use with oxidising wound cleaning agents, soap, other anionic materials, or potassium iodide

Contra-indication: Do not use in patients with known hypersensitivity to phenothiazines.

Do not use in comatose states or in the presence of large amounts of central nervous system depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, etc.).

Side effects: Note: Some adverse effects of chlorpromazine may be more likely to occur, or occur with greater intensity, in patients with special medical problems, e.g., patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses.

Precaution: Some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia,

Chlorpromazine should be administered cautiously to persons with cardiovascular, liver or renal disease. There is evidence that patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis have increased sensitivity to the CNS effects of chlorpromazine (i.e., impaired cerebration and abnormal slowing of the EEG).

Because of its CNS depressant effect, chlorpromazine should be used with caution in patients with chronic respiratory disorders such as severe asthma, emphysema and acute respiratory infections, particularly in children (1 to 12 years of age).

Because chlorpromazine can suppress the cough reflex, aspiration of vomitus is possible.

Mode of action: Chlorpromazine is a neuroleptic that acts by blocking the postsynaptic dopamine receptor in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and inhibits the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones. It has antiemetic, serotonin-blocking, and weak antihistaminic properties and slight ganglion-blocking activity.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Potentiation of anticholinergic effects of antiparkinson agents and TCAs may lead to an anticholinergic crisis. Additive orthostatic hypotensive effect in combination with MAOIs. Reverses antihypertensive effect of guanethidine, methyldopa and clonidine.

Potentially Fatal: Rare. Severe hyponatraemia and idiosyncratic hypersensitivity.

Precaution: Existing fluid and electrolyte disturbances, hepatic cirrhosis, severe heart failure, hyperuricaemia, mild to moderate renal impairment. Elderly. Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance. Kidney or liver disease; diabetes; gout; hyperlipidaemia and ventricular extra systoles.

Mode of action: Chlortalidone is an oral, long acting antihypertensive/diuretic. It is a monosulfamyl diuretic that acts by enhancing the excretion of sodium and chloride ions, and water by interfering with the transport of sodium ions across the renal tubular epithelium. Their primary site of action appears to be at the cortical diluting segment in the nephron of the loop of Henle.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction:  	NSAIDs antagonise hypotensive action. Suppresses action of oral anticoagulants due to reduced prothrombin activity. Increased risk of hypokalaemia when corticosteroids are given concurrently.
Potentially Fatal: Potentiates bone marrow suppression caused by anticancer drugs. Diuretic-induced vol depletion can potentiate aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. Impairs action of oral hypoglycaemic agents. Enhances digitalis toxicity due to hypokalaemia. vol depletion enhances lithium toxicity, conversely, sudden withdrawal of diuretics may result in subtherapeutic levels of circulating lithium.

	Indication: Osteoporosis, Hypoparathyroidism, Rickets, Osteomalacia,Vitamin D Deficiency, Pseudohypoparathyroidism, Familial hypophosphatemia

Dose: Oral /IM solution:
Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3) is recommended 5-10 mcg or 1-2ml (200-400 IU)/day or as directed by the physician.

May also be given via IM inj.

Contra-indication: Colecalciferol is contraindicated in all diseases associated with hypercalcaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Colecalciferol (or medicines of the same class) and any of the constituent excipients. Colecalciferol is contraindicated if there is evidence of vitamin D toxicity.

Side effects: Generally all nutritional supplements are considered to be safe and well tolerable. However, few side-effects can generally occur including hypercalcaemia syndrome or Calcium intoxication (depending on the severity and duration of hypercalcaemia), occasional acute symptoms include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or stomach ache and constipation with the administration of Colecaciferol.

Precaution: People with the following conditions should exercise caution when considering taking vitamin D supplements:
High blood Calcium or Phosphorus level
Heart problems
Kidney disease

Vitamin D must be taken with adequate amounts of both Calcium and Magnesium supplementation. When Calcium level is low (due to insufficient vitamin D and calcium intake), the body activates the parathyroid gland, which produces PTH (parathyroid hormone). This hormone kick starts vitamin D hormone production and assists removal of Calcium from the bones to be used in more important functions such as neutralizing body acidity.

Mode of action: Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble sterol. It is necessary for the regulation and regulation of calcium and phosphate homoeostasis and bone mineralisation. Vitamin D is also essential for healthy bones as it aids in Calcium absorption from the GI tract. In addition to this it stimulates bone formation. 

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: Increased risk of hypercalcaemia if given with thiazide diuretics, calcium or phosphate. Antiepileptics (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin & primidone) may increase vitamin D requirements. Rifampicin & isoniazid may reduce efficacy of vitamin D. Corticosteroids may counteract the effect of vitamin D. Digoxin or any cardiac glycoside. Reduced absorption when taken with cholestyramine, colestipol, mineral oil, orlistat. Ketoconazole.Indication:  Bile acid-induced diarrhoea; Hyperlipidaemias, Pruritus associated w/ partial biliary obstruction or primary biliary cirrhosis

Dose: Hyperlipidaemias

Child: >6 yr: 240 mg/kg daily in divided doses.
 
Pruritus associated with partial biliary obstruction or primary biliary cirrhosis
Adult: 4-8 g daily.
Child: >6 yr: 240 mg/kg daily in divided doses.

Contra-indication: Complete biliary obstruction; hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Constipation; faecal impaction; haemorrhoids; abdominal discomfort or pain; heartburn; flatulence; nausea; vomiting; diarrhoea; increased bleeding tendency (chronic use); osteoporosis; steatorrhoea (high doses); skin rashes; pruritus of the tongue, skin and perianal region; hyperchloraemic acidosis.

Precaution: Admin as a suspension in water or a flavored vehicle to minimise risk of oesophageal obstruction. May interfere with absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and folic acid and prolonged use may be associated with an increased bleeding tendency. Pregnancy; lactation.

Potentially Fatal: Hypersensitivity reaction including angioedema.

Precaution: Moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment, CV diseases. Not indicated for chronic kidney disease patients who are not receiving dialysis. Do not initiate Cinacalcet in hypocalcaemic patients. For secondary hyperparathyroidism, measure serum calcium and phosphorus (prior to- and within 1 wk after initiation/dose adjustment; mthly during maintenance) and iPTH (prior to- and within 1-4 wk after initiation/dosage adjustment; every 1-3 mth during maintenance). iPTH levels should drawn at least 12 hr after Cinacalcet dosing. 

For parathyroid carcinoma and primary parathyroidism, measure serum calcium prior-to and within 1 wk after initiation/dose adjustment; and every 2-3 mth during maintenance. Vitamin D sterols, calcium-containing phosphate binder and/or adjustment of calcium contents of dialysis fluid can be used to raise serum calcium in the event of hypocalcaemia. Reduce dose or withhold therapy if hypocalcaemia persists; may reinstate treatment at the next lowest dose after calcium levels normalised. Significant reduction in serum calcium may lower seizure threshold. Adynamic bone disease may develop if iPTH level is suppressed to < 100 pg/mL. May decrease total and free testosterone levels. Safety and efficacy not established in patients ?18 yr. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent. It lowers parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor of the parathyroid gland to activation by extracellular calcium. PTH reduction leads to concomitant decrease in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Cinacalcet is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor and may increase serum concentrations of amitriptyline, nortriptyline and desipramine. Cinacalcet may decrease serum concentrations of tacrolimus.

Mode of action: Cinnarizine has calcium-channel blocking activity selective for arterial smooth muscle. It also has some antihistamine activity. Cinnarizine acts as a labyrinthine sedative. It also improves microcirculation by reducing ischaemia-induced blood viscosity.

Dimenhydrinate is an antihistamine which also has antimuscarinic and central sedative action. It also exerts a depressant action on hyperstimulated labyrinthine function.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Cinnarizine: CNS depressant effect enhanced with alcohol. Action potentiated by domperidone.

Dimenhydrinate: Physically incompatible with aminophylline, hydrocortisone, phenothiazines and some barbiturates in solution.
Potentially Fatal: Potentiates the sedative effects of CNS depressants including alcohol, barbiturates, opioid analgesics, sedatives and neuroleptics. MAOIs, atropine, TCAs enhance antimuscarinic effect. Masks ototoxicity produced by aminoglycoside antibiotics.ACI	Floxabid Powder for Suspension 250mg/5ml 60ml bot 100.30 BDT

Dose: Eye:
Corneal Ulcers: The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of corneal ulcer is two drops into the affected eye every 15 minutes for the first six hours and then two drops into the affected eye every 30 minutes for the remainder of the first day. On the second day, instill two drops in the affected eye hourly. On the third through the fourteenth day, place two drops in the affected eye every four hours. Treatment may be continued after 14 days if corneal re-epithelialization has not occurred.
Bacterial Conjunctivitis:
The recommended dosage regimen for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis is one or two drops instilled into the conjunctival sac(s) every two hours while awake for two days and one or two drops every four hours while awake for the next five days.

Ear:
Four drops instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days. The suspension should be warmed by holding the bottle in the hand for one or two minutes to avoid dizziness, which may result from the instillation of a cold suspension. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward, and then the suspension should be instilled. This position should be maintained for 60 seconds. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

Paediatric Use:
Ear: Safety and effectiveness of this suspension in pediatric (6 months of age and older) patients for ear application have been established.
Eye:
Safety and effectiveness of this suspension in pediatric patients for eye application have not been established.



Contra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the product. Herpes simplex and other viral conditions, mycosis, glaucoma, newborn babies, fungal diseases of ocular or auricular structures.

Mode of action: Ciprofloxacin promotes breakage of double-stranded DNA in susceptible organisms and inhibits DNA gyrase, which is essential in reproduction of bacterial DNA.
Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Its anti-inflammatory action is due to the suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It may also be used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical insufficiency.


Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: May increase plasma concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. clozapine, ropinirole, theophylline). Enhances effect of oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) and glibenclamide. Increased toxicity of methotrexate. Plasma concentrations may be increased by probenecid. Reduced absorption w/ oral multivitamins and mineral supplements containing divalent or trivalent cations (e.g. Fe, Zn, Ca) and antacids containing Al, Ca or Mg. Concomitant use w/ class IA antiarrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, procainamide), class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), TCAs, macrolides and antipsychotics may result in additive effects on QT interval prolongation. Concurrent use w/ corticosteroids may increase risk of severe tendon disorders. Increased risk of CNS stimulation w/ NSAIDs. Altered serum concentrations of phenytoin.
Potentially Fatal: Marked elevation in serum levels of tizanidine which is associated w/ potentiated hypotensive and sedative effect.
 	Thiazides may enhance hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia caused by corticosteroids. Increased incidence of peptic ulcer or GI bleeding with concurrent NSAIDs admin. Response to anticoagulants altered. Dose of antidiabetics and antihypertensives needs to be increased. Decreases serum conc of salicylates and antimuscarinic agents. Ethanol may enhance gastric mucosal irritation. Reduced efficacy with concurrent use of carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, barbiturates and rifampicin. Mutual inhibition of metabolism between ciclosporin and corticosteroids increase plasma conc of both drugs. Enhanced effect in women taking oestrogens or oral contraceptives.ACI	Floxabid Eye Drops 0.3% 5ml drop 40.12 BDT

	Indication: Prevention of gout and kidney stones, Urine alkalinization, Renal tubular acidosis

Dose: To relieve discomfort in UTI:
Adults & children over 6 years: 10 ml 3 times daily, diluted with 1 glass of water.
Children 1-6 years: 5 ml 3 times daily, diluted with 1/2 glass of water.

To prevent kidney stones, acidosis caused by kidney diseases, with uricosuric agent to prevent gout:
Adults: 10-15 ml 4 times daily; or as directed by the physician, diluted with 1 glass of water.
Pediatric: 5-10ml 4 times daily; or as directed by the physician, diluted with 1/2 glass of water.

Contra-indication: The drug is contraindicated in severe renal impairment with oliguria or azotemia, untreated Addison's disease, acute dehydration, severe myocardial damage, and hyperkalemia from any cause.

Side effects: This solution is generally well tolerated without any unpleasant side effect when given in recommended doses to patients with normal renal function and urinary output. However, as with any alkalinizing agent, caution must be used in certain patients with abnormal renal mechanisms to avoid development of hyperkalemia or alkalosis. Potassium intoxication causes listlessness, weakness, mental confusion, tingling of extremities, and other symptoms associated with a high concentration of potassium in the serum. 

Precaution: The solution should be used with caution in patients with low urinary output. It should be diluted adequately with water to minimize the possibility of gastrointestinal injury associated with the oral ingestion of concentrated potassium salt preparations; and preferably, to take each dose after meals. Large doses may cause hyperkalemia and alkalosis, especially in the presence of renal disease.

Mode of action: Potassium citrate is absorbed and metabolized to potassium bicarbonate and this acts as a systemic alkalizer .

Mode of action: Clarithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 50s ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It has activity against susceptible streptococci and staphylococci as well as other species including B. catarrhalis, L. spp, C. trachomatis and U. urealyticum.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Reduced efficacy w/ CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine). Strong inducers of CYP450 system (e.g. efavirenz, rifampicin) may accelerate metabolism, thus lower plasma levels of clarithromycin. Inhibition of metabolism w/ ritonavir. Torsades de pointes may result from concomitant quinidine or disopyramide. Increased phosphodiesterase inhibitor exposure w/ sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil. Increased risk of digoxin toxicity. Decreased concentration of zidovudine. Concomitant use w/ atazanavir, itraconazole or saquinavir may result to bi-directional drug interactions. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis may result when taken w/ verapamil. Increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis w/ HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Increased risk of hypoglycaemia w/ oral hypoglycaemic drugs (e.g. pioglitazone) and insulin. Risk of serious haemorrhage and elevation of INR and prothrombin time w/ oral anticoagulants. Increased ototoxicity w/ aminoglycosides. Increased and prolonged sedation w/ triabenzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam).
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine or dihydroergotamine) is associated w/ acute ergot toxicity characterised by vasospasm and ischaemia of the extremities. Concomitant use w/ astemizole, cisapride, pimozide and terfenadine may result in QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia.Beximco	Pylopac TAB dr  7's pack 315 BDT
	Indication: H. pylori infection, Peptic ulcer disease

Dose: One strip lansoprazole, 30 mg; clarithromycin, 500 mg; and metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 7-14 days or as per the physicians advice. 

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to any component. Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin should not be given to patients with history of QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes. 

Side effects: Adverse reactions which were reported as possibly or probably related to treatment (<3%) in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly are listed below and divided by body systems. Digestive system : nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dark stool, glossitis, oral moniliasis, stomatitis, tongue discoloration, Musculoskeletal System : myalgia, Nervous System : confusion, headache, dizziness, Skin : skin reactions, Urological System : vaginitis, vaginal moniliasis. 

Precaution: Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy, including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.

Mode of action: Clarithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 50s ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It has activity against susceptible streptococci and staphylococci as well as other species including B. catarrhalis, L. spp, C. trachomatis and U. urealyticum.

Lansoprazole is a substituted benzimidazole, and is also known as PPI due to its property to block the final step of acid secretion by inhibiting H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system in gastric parietal cell. Both basal and stimulated acid are inhibited.

Metronidazole is converted to reduction products that interact w/ DNA to cause destruction of helical DNA structure and strand leading to a protein synthesis inhibition and cell death in susceptible organisms. It is active against most anaerobic protozoa, some gm+ve, gm-ve and facultative anaerobes.

It should be applied to the dry (not wet) scalp once a day to the affected areas only.
It should be massaged gently into the lesions and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing.
Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks.
Total dosage of shampoo should not exceed 50 g per week.
Under 18 years this preparation is not recommended.

Contra-indication: Childn <12 yrs. Long-term treatment of ulcerative conditions, rosacea, pruritus; It is contraindicated in rosacea, acne vulgaris, perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infections (eg. herpes simplex, chickenpox), otitis externa with a perforated eardrum, hypersensitivity to the preparations. Scalp application is contraindicated in infection of the scalp.

Side effects: Perioral dermatitis, striae esp in flexures. Dermal and epidermal atrophy esp on the face, steroid purpura. Potentially Fatal: Prolonged usage of large amount of clobetasol propionate can lead to sufficient systemic levels to produce adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, diabetes and hypertension.

Precaution: Long-term continuous topical therapy should be avoided where possible, particularly in infants and children, as adrenal suppression can occur readily even without occlusion.

Dose: Adults and children over 2 years:
Apply sparingly to the affected area once or twice daily until improvement occurs. As with other highly active topical steroid preparations therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. 

Treatment should not be continued for more than 7 days without medical supervision. If a longer course is necessary, it is recommended that treatment should not be continued for more than 4 weeks without the patient's condition being reviewed. 

Elderly: This preparation is suitable for use in the elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.

Children: Under 2 years this preparation is not recommended.

Contra-indication: Childn <12 yrs. Long-term treatment of ulcerative conditions, rosacea, pruritus; presence of acute infections. Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Perioral dermatitis, striae esp in flexures. Dermal and epidermal atrophy esp on the face, steroid purpura.
Potentially Fatal: Prolonged usage of large amount of clobetasol propionate can lead to sufficient systemic levels to produce adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, diabetes and hypertension.

Flammable. Do not use or dry the hair near a fire or flame.

Mode of action: Clobetasol is a highly active corticosteroid that has topical anti-inflammatory action brought about partly by vasoconstriction and reduced collagen synthesis. Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that binds to ribosomal 30S and 50S subunits of susceptible bacteria, thus inhibiting protein synthesis; it also causes misreading of the genetic codes on the mRNA template. Nystatin works by binding to ergosterol in the cell membrane of fungus resulting in a change in the cell wall permeability and leakage of cellular components.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: If there is substantial systemic absorption, neomycin may prolong and intensify respiratory depressant effects of neuromuscular blockers.Eskayef Bangladesh Ltd.	Topiclo-S Ointment   10gm  tube 70 BDT

Dose: Adult: Topical Acne; Hyperkeratotic and scaling skin conditions As 2-6% preparation: Apply >3 times/day. Warts and calluses As 60% preparation: Apply as directed.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity

Side effects: Prolonged usage of large amount of clobetasol propionate can lead to sufficient systemic levels to produce adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, diabetes and hypertension.Dermal and epidermal atrophy esp on the face, steroid purpura

Precaution: Not for prolonged use in high concentrations and on large areas of the body. Impaired peripheral circulation or diabetes. Avoid broken skin, mouth, eyes, mucous membranes and anogenital region.

Mode of action: Corticosteroids decrease inflammation by stabilizing leukocyte lysosomal membranes, preventing release of destructive acid hydrolases from leukocytes; inhibiting macrophage accumulation in inflamed areas; reducing leukocyte adhesion to capillary endothelium; reducing capillary wall permeability and edema formation; decreasing complement components; antagonizing histamine activity and release of kinin from substrates; and reducing fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and subsequent scar tissue formation.

Salicylic acid has a potent keratolytic action and a slight antiseptic action when applied topically. It softens and destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration which causes the horny layer of the skin to swell, soften, and then desquamate. At high concentrations, salicylic acid has a caustic effect. It also possesses weak antifungal and antibacterial activity.

Interaction:Indication: Leprosy

Dose: Adult: PO Multibacillary leprosy 300 mg (w/ rifampicin 600 mg) once mthly combined w/ 50 mg (w/ dapsone 100 mg) daily for 12 mth. Erythema nodosum leprosum (Type 2) Treatment depends on severity. 100-200 mg/day for up to 3 mth. Doses >200 mg/day are not recommended. Gradually taper the dose to 100 mg/day as soon as the reactive episode is controlled. Dapsone-resistant leprosy 100 mg/day w/ 1 or more other antileprosy drugs for 3 yr, then continue as a monotherapy at 100 mg/day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity. Lactation.

Side effects: Red-brownish black discolouration of skin especially areas exposed to sunlight, hair, sweat, sputum, urine, faeces. Rash, pruritus, photosensitivity, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, taste disorders, dryness of the skin, ichthyosis, decreased tear and sweat production.
Potentially Fatal: Crystal depletion in the wall of small bowel mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Severe abdominal symptoms including bowel obstruction, GI bleeding and splenic infarction.

Precaution: Pregnancy. Patients with GI symptoms.

Mode of action: Clofazamine inhibits mycobacterial growth by binding preferentially to mycobacterial DNA. It also has some anti-inflammatory activity.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Dapsone
Concomitant use of dapsone and clofazimine does not have a clinically important effect on dapsone pharmacokinetics.
Some evidence suggests dapsone may decrease or nullify some anti-inflammatory effects of clofazimine and theoretically might adversely affect clofazimine’s efficacy in patients with ENL reactions; several borderline leprosy and lepromatous leprosy patients with severe, recurrent ENL reactions reportedly required higher clofazimine dosage to control these reactions when dapsone therapy was given concomitantly than when clofazimine was given alone.

Isoniazid
Possible increased clofazimine plasma and urine concentrations and decreased clofazimine skin concentrations.

Rifampin
Although one study indicated that concomitant use of clofazimine in leprosy patients receiving rifampin alone or in conjunction with dapsone may decrease plasma concentrations and AUC of rifampin, concomitant use of clofazimine in another study in lepromatous leprosy patients receiving dapsone (100 mg daily) and rifampin (600 mg daily) did not affect rifampin pharmacokinetics.Aristopharma	Clovul TAB dr 50mg 30's pack 150 BDT

	Indication: Epilepsy, Anxiety disorders, Panic disorder, Status epilepticus, Social phobia, Migraines, Parasomnia, Restless legs syndrome, Rapid eye movement, Behavior disorder, Spasticity, Resistant depression, Trigeminal neuralgia, Nocturnal myoclonus, Post traumatic stress disorder, Insomnia and sleep disturbances, Burning Mouth Syndrome


Dose: Adults :1 mg (elderly 500 micrograms) initially at night for 4 nights, increased according to response over 2-4 weeks to usual maintenance dose of 4-8 mg usually at night (may be given in 3-4 divided doses if necessary). 

Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every three days until seizures are adequately controlled.

Children: The initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day and should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses. 

Dosage should be increased by not more than 0.25 to 0.50 mg every third day until a maintenance dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of body weight has been reached, unless seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increase. Whenever possible, the daily dose should be divided into three equal doses. If doses are not equally divided, the larger dose should be given before retiring.


IV Emergency treatment of status epilepticus 1 mg as inj or infusion, repeat if needed.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, acute pulmonary insufficiency, acute narrow angle glaucoma.

Side effects: Drowsiness, fatigue, muscular hypotonia, coordination disturbances, dizziness, vertigo, anorexia, visual disturbances, libido changes.
Potentially Fatal: Salivary or bronchial hypersecretion leading to respiratory problems (children). May produce diminished reflexes or coma. Rarely, blood dyscrasias.

Precaution: Neonates, chronic pulmonary insufficiency, hepatic/renal dysfunction, porphyria, elderly; pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Clonazepam reduces the nerve transmission in the motor cortex which suppresses the spike and wave discharge in absence seizures. Its mechanism is believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of GABA. Clinically, it improves focal epilepsy and generalised seizures.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Additive depressant effect w/ TCAs, MAOIs, sedative and hypnotics, barbiturates, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, opiate agonists. May increase serum phenytoin levels.Navana	Catapres 0.1 TAB dr 100mcg 50's pack 301 BDT

Precaution: Withdraw gradually, renal impairment, tasks that require mental alertness. Cerebrovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease, MI. IV inj should be administered slowly. Occlusive peripheral vascular disorders, history of depression.

Mode of action: Clonidine stimulates alpha-2 receptors in brain stem which results in reduced sympathetic outflow from the CNS and a decrease in peripheral resistance leading to reduced BP and pulse rate. It does not alter normal haemodynamic response to exercise at recommended dosages.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:  	Hypotensive action may be potentiated by diuretics and vasodilators. Effects of clonidine antagonised by TCAs and centrally-acting alpha-blockers. May enhance toxicity due to digitalis, lithium. May antagonise oral hypoglycaemics.
Potentially Fatal: Hypnosedatives, antihistamines and alcohol may cause excessive drowsiness in patients on clonidine.

Side effects:     Serious adverse reactions were not observed in clinical trials.
    The most common adverse reaction was skin rash.
    Other reactions such as chills, muscle cramps, back pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and wheezing were the most frequent adverse reactions observed during the clinical trials of similarly-prepared human IGIV products. 

Precaution:   Patient Monitoring for Administration

    Patients should be well hydrated prior to the initiation.
    Assess renal function, including the measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine prior to the initial infusion.  Periodic monitoring of renal function tests and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential risk for developing acute renal failure.  Increases in serum creatinine and BUN have been observed as soon as one to two days following treatment with other IGIV products.
    During administration, monitor the patient's vital signs continuously and observe the patient carefully for any associated symptoms.
    DO NOT EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED INFUSION RATE of 1 mL/kg/hour (50 mg/kg/h), and follow the infusion schedule closely  . If a patient develops an infusion reaction, slow the rate of infusion immediately or temporarily interrupt the infusion.

Contra-indication: History of bone marrow disorders including agranulocytosis, circulatory collapse, alcoholic or toxic psychosis, drug intoxication, uncontrolled epilepsy, severe renal, hepatic or cardiac disease; paralytic ileus. Pregnancy and lactation.

Side effects: Drowsiness, dizziness, headache; nausea, vomiting, constipation; anxiety, confusion, fatigue, transient fever. Rarely, dysphagia, acute pancreatitis, cholestatic jaundice; orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia; seizures; hypersalivation.Potentially Fatal: Rarely, thromboembolism. Reversible neutropenia which may progress to a potentially fatal agranulocytosis. Fatal myocarditis.

Precaution: Medication should not be stopped abruptly; should be tapered off over 1-2 weeks. If conditions warrant abrupt discontinuation (leukopenia, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy), monitor patient for psychosis and cholinergic rebound (headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Elderly patients are more susceptible to adverse effects (including agranulocytosis, cardiovascular, anticholinergic, and tardive dyskinesia). Significant risk of agranulocytosis, potentially life-threatening. Leucocyte counts should be monitored regularly and for at least 4 wk after treatment discontinuation. Renal, hepatic or cardiac impairment; prostatic enlargement, narrow-angle glaucoma; elderly; immobilised patients

Mode of action: Clozapine has relatively weak dopamine receptor-blocking activity at D1, D2, D3 and D5 receptors but has high affinity for the D4 receptor. It has also blocking effects on serotonin, ?-adrenergic histamine H1 and cholinergic receptors.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction:  	Increased risk and/or severity of bone marrow suppression w/ bone marrow suppressants (e.g. carbamazepine, chloramphenicol), sulfonamides (e.g. co-trimoxazole), pyrazolone analgesics (e.g. phenylbutazone), penicillamine, cytotoxic agents or long-acting depot inj of antipsychotics. Concomitant use w/ benzodiazepines may increase risk of circulatory collapse which may lead to cardiac and/or resp arrest. Additive CNS depression and cognitive and motor performance interference w/ MAOIs and CNS depressants including antihistamines, benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics. May potentiate effects of anticholinergics or antihypertensives. Increased plasma concentration of highly protein bound substances (e.g. warfarin, digoxin). Decreased plasma concentrations w/ phenytoin. Concomitant use w/ lithium can increase the risk of development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Decreased clozapine levels w/ CYP1A2 inducers (e.g. omeprazole). Increased clozapine levels w/ CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, caffeine, ciprofloxacin).Indication: Hemophilia B or Christmas disease

Dose: In adult PTPs, on average, one international unit of coagulation factor ix recombinant per kilogram of body weight increased the circulating activity of factor IX by 0.8 ± 0.2 (range 0.4 to 1.4) IU/dL. 

In pediatric patients, on average, one international unit of coagulation factor ix recombinant per kilogram of body weight increased the circulating activity of factor IX by 0.7 ± 0.3 (range 0.2 to 2.1 IU/dL; median of 0.6 IU/dL per IU/kg). 

Contra-indication:  patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to hamster protein.

Side effects:     fever or chills;
    continued bleeding after treatment;
    feeling like you might pass out;
    sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body;
    sudden headache, confusion, problems with vision, speech, or balance; or
    swelling in your feet or ankles, weight gain, loss of appetite.

Less serious side effects may be more likely to occur, such as:

    headache;
    warmth, redness, or tingly feeling under your skin;
    nausea, vomiting;
    dizziness; or
    pain, redness, or swelling where the medicine was injected.

Precaution: Activity-neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) have been detected in patients receiving factor IXcontaining products. As with all factor IX products, patients using  (coagulation factor ix recombinant) should be monitored for the development of factor IX inhibitors . Patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis upon subsequent challenge with factor IX.

 Patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of inhibitor. Preliminary information suggests a relationship may exist between the presence of major deletion mutations in a patient's factor IX gene and an increased risk of inhibitor formation and of acute hypersensitivity reactions. 

Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of acute hypersensitivity reactions, particularly during the early phases of initial exposure to product. In view of the potential for allergic reactions with factor IX concentrates, the initial (approximately 10 - 20) administrations of factor IX should be performed under medical supervision where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.

Mode of action: Factor IX is used as replacement therapy in patients with haemophilia B whereby there is a genetic deficiency of factor IX.

It slows down excessive epidermal cell turnover and is often used topically either alone or in combination with other drugs (e.g. salicyclic acid, sulfur) in conditions such as dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis or psoriasis.

Sulfur is a keratolytic, mild antiseptic, mild antifungal and parasiticide.

Salicylic acid has a potent keratolytic action and a slight antiseptic action when applied topically. It softens and destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration which causes the horny layer of the skin to swell, soften, and then desquamate. At high concentrations, salicylic acid has a caustic effect. It also possesses weak antifungal and antibacterial activity.

Side effects: Hypertension; hepatoxicity; tremor; paraesthesia, hypertrichosis, facial oedema, acne; gingival hypertrophy; hyperkalaemia, fluid retention; increased susceptibility to infections; GI symptoms. Potentially Fatal: Nephrotoxicity; convulsions.

Precaution:  Cyclosporine increases the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. So patients should be warned to avoid excess ultraviolet light exposure. Cyclosporine may develop bacterial, fungal, parasitic and viral infections. So therapeutic strategies should be employed for long-term immunosuppressive therapy. A reversible increase in serum creatinine and urea may occur during the first few weeks of Cyclosporine therapy and usually responding to dose reduction. In elderly patients, renal function should be monitored with particular care. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is required during Cyclosporine therapy; if hypertension develops, appropriate antihypertensive treatment must be instituted.  Cyclosporine enhances the risk of hyperkalaemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Caution is also required when Cyclosporine is co-administered with potassium sparing drugs. Cyclosporine enhances the clearance of magnesium. If considered necessary, magnesium supplementation should be given. Caution should be observed in treating patients with hyperuricaemia. During treatment with Cyclosporine, vaccination may be less effective; the use of live-attenuated vaccines should be avoided. Non-transplant patients with impaired renal function, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled infections, or any kind of malignancy should not receive Cyclosporine. Renal and hepatic impairment; hyperuricaemia; anaphylaxis; history of allergic reactions; pregnancy; monitor BP, serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function.

Dose: Adult: PO: 200-800 mg/day in 2 divided doses for 3-6 mth, up to 9 mth if needed. It is recommended that danazol therapy in adult females should start on the first day of the menstrual cycle with an adjustment of dosage made subsequently to achieve amenorrhoea or the desired effect.  

In endometrosis : The initial dose is 400 mg daily usually continued for 6 months. If symptoms do not resolve, the dose can be increased to 800 mg daily but the total course should not exceed 9 months.  

Benign breast disease: Severe cyclical mastalgia. The recommended initial dose for severe cyclical mastalgia is 200-300 mg daily for 3-6 month. In several studies, the initial dose was either 200 mg or 300 mg daily, which was reduced after either 1 or 2 months if a clinically useful response had occurred.  

Benign, multiple or recurrent breast disease: The recommended initial dose for this indication is 300 mg daily for 3-6 months.  

Menorrhagia: In menorrhagia, daily doses of 100-200 mg have been found effective but 200 mg daily is usually sufficient to reduce menstrual blood flow to acceptable levels. The recommended initial dose is 200 mg daily for 3 months.  

Gynecomastia: Adults, 300-600 mg daily. Adolescents, 200-300 mg daily.  

Preoperative thinning of the endometrium before hysteroscopic endometrial ablation: Danazol induces endometrial atrophy and is currently recommended at doses of 400-800 mg daily for up to 3 months preoperatively.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, lactation, porphyria, thromboembolic disorders; undiagnosed genital bleeding, markedly impaired renal, cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.

Side effects: Oedema, wt gain, sweating, acne, hirsutism, flushing, oily skin or hair, deepening of the voice, clitoral hypertrophy, amenorrhoea, hepatic dysfunction, CNS or GI disturbances, benign intracranial hypertension, reduction in breast size, visual disturbances, elevated LFT values.   Other adverse effects: Include menstrual disturbances, hypo-estrogenic symptoms, such as flushing, vaginal dryness and irritation and a modest reduction of spermatogenesis in the male. Maculopapular, petechial, purpuric and urticarial rashes have been reported. Cardiovascular reactions may include exacerbation of hypertension, palpitations and tachycardia. Various psychological reactions such as increased appetite, emotional lability, anxiety, depression, nervousness, changes in libido, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, headache and fatigue have been described. Potentially Fatal: Thromboembolic events and fatal strokes have been reported.

Precaution: Danazol may cause some degree of fluid retention, conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as epilepsy, migraine, or cardiac or renal dysfunction, polycythemia and hypertension require careful observation. Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.  Since hepatic dysfunction manifested by modest increases in serum transaminases levels has been reported in patients treated with Danazol, periodic liver function tests should be performed  Administration of danazol has been reported to cause exacerbation of the manifestations of acute intermittent porphyria. 

Mode of action: Danazol suppresses the pituitary-ovarian axis by reducing the release of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. This causes the regression and atrophy of endometrial tissue, decreases growth rate of abnormal breast tissue and reduces attacks in hereditary angioedema.

	Indication: Premature ejaculation 

Dose: Recommended Starting Dose: 30 mg, taken as needed approximately 1-3 hrs prior to sexual activity.
Maximum Recommended Dosing Frequency: Once every 24 hrs. If the effect of 30 mg is insufficient and the side effects are acceptable, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg.

Elderly (>65 years): Safety and efficacy of Dapoxetine have not been established in patients >65 years as limited data are available in this population.

Children and Adolescents: Dapoxetine should not be used in individuals <18 years.

Patients with Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is required but caution is advised in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Dapoxetine is not recommended for use in the patients with severe renal impairment.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Dapoxetine is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.

Before treatment is initiated, the physician should obtain a careful medical history focusing on past orthostatic events and also perform an orthostatic test (blood pressure and pulse rate, supine and standing). If the patient discloses a history suggestive of orthostatic reactions or an orthostatic test shows this kind of reaction, treatment with Dapoxetine should be avoided.

Contra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to dapoxetine HCl or to any of the excipients.
Patients with significant pathological cardiac conditions [eg, heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), conduction abnormalities (2nd- or 3rd-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome) not treated with a permanent pacemaker, significant ischemic heart disease or significant valvular disease].
Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI. Similarly, a MAOI should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.

Concomitant treatment with thioridazine, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with thioridazine. Similarly, thioridazine should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.

Concomitant treatment with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)] or other medicinal/herbal products with serotonergic effects or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with these medicinal/herbal products. Similarly these medicinal/herbal products should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.

Side effects: Syncope characterized as loss of consciousness has been reported.The majority of cases occurred during the first 3 hrs after dosing, after the 1st dose or associated with study-related procedures in the clinic setting (eg, blood draw and orthostatic maneuvers and blood pressure measurements). Prodromal symptoms often preceded the syncope.
Orthostatic hypotension has been reported in clinical trials.

The most common adverse drug reactions (5%) reported during clinical trials were headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, insomnia and fatigue. The most common events leading to discontinuation were nausea and dizziness.

Precaution: General: Dapoxetine is only indicated in men with PE. Safety has not been established and there are no data on the ejaculation-delaying effects in men without PE.

Use with Recreational Drugs: Patients should be advised not to use Dapoxetine in combination with recreational drugs. Recreational drugs with serotonergic activity eg, ketamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may lead to potentially serious reactions if combined with Dapoxetine. These reactions include, but are not limited to, arrhythmia, hyperthermia and serotonin syndrome. 

Use of Dapoxetine with recreational drugs with sedative properties eg, narcotics and benzodiazepines may further increase somnolence and dizziness.

Ethanol: Combining alcohol with Dapoxetine may increase alcohol-related neurocognitive effects and may also enhance neurocardiogenic adverse events eg, syncope, thereby increasing the risk of accidental injury; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Dapoxetine.

Possibly prodromal symptoms eg, nausea, dizziness/lightheadedness and diaphoresis were reported more frequently among patients treated with Dapoxetine compared to placebo.

Orthostatic Hypotension: An orthostatic test should be performed before initiating therapy. In case of a history of documented or suspected orthostatic reaction, treatment with Dapoxetine should be avoided.

Dapoxetine is not indicated for psychiatric disorders and should not be used in men with these disorders eg, schizophrenia, or in those suffering with co-morbid depression, as worsening of symptoms associated with depression cannot be excluded.

Withdrawal Effects: Abrupt discontinuation of chronically administered SSRIs used to treat chronic depressive disorders has been reported to result in the following symptoms: Dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (eg, paresthesias, electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia and hypomania.

Mode of action: Dapoxetine  selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin. It has limited direct action at other neurotransmitter sites including muscarinic receptors.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction: Potential serious reactions w/ MAOIs. Inhibits metabolism of thioridazine. Risk of serotonergic-associated effects w/ serotonergic medicinal/herbal products (including L-tryptophan, triptans, tramadol, linezolid, SSRIs, SNRIs, lithium & St. John's wort prep).

	Indication: Urge incontinence, Urinary frequency and urgency, Overactive bladder

Dose: Adult: PO Initial: 7.5 mg once daily; may increase dose to 15 mg once daily if no adequate response after 2 wk of therapy. Daily dose should not exceed 7.5 mg/day if use concurrently w/ strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Contra-indication: Patient with urinary retention, gastric retention, uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, and in patients who are at risk for these conditions.

Side effects: Dry mouth, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, dizziness, headache, asthaenia, pain, weight gain, dry skin, rash, pruritus, dry eyes, abnormal vision, arthralgia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, flu-like syndrome, UTI, vaginitis, acute urinary retention, hypertension and peripheral oedema.
Potentially Fatal: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema.

Precaution: Anticholinergic agents including Darifenacin, may cause urinary retention and decreased GI motility. Caution when used in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction, GI obstructive disorder (e.g. pyloric stenosis), severe constipation, ulcerative colitis, and myasthenia gravis. For patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, caution and only use where potential benefits outweigh the risks. May cause heat prostration when used in a hot environment. May cause dizziness and blurred vision; caution when operating machinery or driving vehicle. Not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Safety and efficacy have not been established in paediatric patients. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Darifenacin is a potent, competitive and selective muscarinic receptor antagonist which has greater binding affinity for muscarinic M3 receptors. M3 receptors are involved in the contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder, GI smooth muscle, saliva production, and iris sphincter function. Darifenacin may increase volume threshold in patients with involuntary detrusor contraction, thus increase bladder capacity.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) or CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, paroxetine) may increase serum levels of Darifenacin. CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. barbiturates, phenytoin, rifampicin) may likely decrease Darifenacin serum concentrations. Darifenacin may act as a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6, caution when used concomitantly with CYP2D6 substrates that have narrow therapeutic index (e.g. flecainide, thioridazine, imipramine). Concurrent use of another agent with antimuscarinic properties may potentiate the side effects of Darifenacin.Indication: Acute leukaemia, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma

Patients should receive calcium and vitamin D supplements whilst undergoing treatment.

Elderly: Based on the available safety and efficacy data in the elderly, no dosage adjustment is required.
Renal Impairment: Based on the available safety and efficacy data in the elderly, no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.

Patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/min] or receiving dialysis are at greater risk of developing hypocalcemia. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in patients with severe renal impairment or receiving dialysis.

Hepatic Impairment: The safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.

Contra-indication: Clinically significant hypersensitivity to denosumab or to any of the components. Hypocalcemia.

Side effects: Cataracts; pain in extremity.

Precaution: Correct hypocalcemia prior to initiation of therapy. Patients should receive Ca & vit D supplements during treatment (unless hypercalcemia is present). Skin infections predominantly cellulitis may develop. Osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients w/ advanced cancer. Atypical femoral fracture. Severe renal impairment or undergoing dialysis. Pregnancy & lactation. Childn.

Mode of action: Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that targets and binds with high affinity and specificity to receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) preventing RANKL from activating its only receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors, independent of bone surface. Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function and survival. Denosumab therefore reduces bone resorption and increases bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Increased risk of serious infections w/ immunosuppressive agents.Denosumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a drug metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).

Treatment should be stopped for 4 wk prior to and for 2 wk after surgery associated with increased risk of thromboembolism or during periods of prolonged immbolisation.

Mode of action: Desogestrel is a progestogen that is structurally related to levonorgestrel while ethinylestradiol is a synthetic oestrogen. Used together, they inhibit ovulation by a negative feedback mechanism on the hypothalamus, which alters the normal FSH and LH secretion pattern by the anterior pituitary. It inhibits the follicular phase FSH and midcycle surge of gonadotropins. It also causes changes in the cervical mucus, making it unsuitable for sperm penetration. It may also alter tubal transport of the ova through the fallopian tubes. Progestational agents may also alter sperm fertility.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Serum levels may be increased when used with paracetamol, ascorbic acid, atorvastatin. Serum levels may be reduced by aprepitant, griseofulvin, modafinil, troglitazone, rifampicin, topiramate, nevirapine, amprenavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and ritonavir. May affect the efficacy of coumarin derivatives. Concurrent use with aminoglutethimide, carbamazepine, felbamate, phenobarbital, phenytoin or topiramate may lead to decrease in contraceptive effectiveness. May reduce the clearance of alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. May increase the clearance of lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid. May inhibit the metabolism of theophylline, ciclosporin and prednisolone. May decrease the serum levels of lamotrigine.

<30 mL/min or ESRD	  50 mg every other day. Additional doses should not be given after dialysis.

Hepatic impairment: 50 mg once daily. Doses >100 mg/day are not advised.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to Desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine or any component of the formulation. Concomitant/recent (within preceeding 14 days) use of MAOI. Do not initiate MAOI at least 7 days after discontinuing Desvenlafaxine.

Side effects: Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, headache, tinnitus, insomnia, abnormal dreams, fatigue, constipation, diarrhoea, somnolence, decreased appetite, irritability, anxiety, tremor, paresthesia, male sexual function disorders (e.g. decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction), urinary hesitancy, hyperhidrosis, blurred vision, mydriasis, palpitations, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, dyslipidemia, proteinuria, and abnormal liver function test.
Potentially Fatal: Serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like reactions.

Precaution: May be associated with increased risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in children, adolescents, and young adults with major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Monitor patients for clinical worsening of depression, emergence of suicidality, unusual changes in behaviour particularly during initiation of therapy and during dosage adjustments. Serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have occurred with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or SNRI treatment alone; and particularly with concomitant use of MAOI, serotogenic agents (e.g. triptans), antipsychotics or dopamine antagonists. 

Gradually taper dose if discontinuing to reduce risk of withdrawal symptoms. May activate mania/hypomania, caution in patients with history or family history of mania or hypomania. Caution in patients with pre-existing glaucoma, hypertension, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or lipid metabolism and seizure disorders. Sustained elevations in blood pressure have been reported. May be associated with dose-related increase in serum total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides. May increase risk of bleeding. 

May be associated with development of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and Hyponatraemia, elderly and patients who are taking diuretics or with volume depletion may be at greater risk. Interstitial lung disease and eosinophilic pneumonia associated with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine) have been reported. Medications containing venlafaxine should not be used concomitantly. Renal and hepatic impairment. Safety and efficacy have not been established in paediatrics. Elderly. Pregnancy. Not recommended in lactation.

Mode of action: Desvenlafaxine, the major active metabolite of venlafaxine, is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Clinical efficacy of desvenlafaxine is thought to be related with the drug's potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in the CNS. It does not have monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitory activity; and has not shown significant affinity for muscarinic cholinergic, H1-histaminergic, ?-adrenergic, dopaminergic, ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and opiate receptors in vitro. At concentrations that inhibit serotonin and norephinephrine reuptake, inhibition of dopamine reuptake appears to be unlikely.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Desvenlafaxine may diminish the therapeutic effect of Iobenguane I-123. May enhance adverse effects of other CNS depressants. Sibutramine and MAOI may enhance the serotonergic effect of Desvenlafaxine; increase risk of development of serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use with alpha-/beta-agonists may enhance tachycardic and vasopressor effect. Desvenlafaxine may increase concentration of CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. desipramine); decrease exposure of CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam). CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) may increase concentration of desvenlafaxine. May enhance the antiplatelet effect of nonselective NSAIDs, aspirin; and anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAOIs may lead to fatal serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions. Do not use within at least 14 days of discontinuing MAOI treatment and start MAOI at least 7 days after stopping desvenlafaxine. Increased risk of serotonin syndrome with sibutramine.ACI	Dexcor TAB dr 0.5mg 100's pack  BDT

	Indication:  Shock, Bronchial asthma, Status asthmaticus, Rheumatoid arthritis, Gout, Severe allergies, Skin diseases, Hyperpyrexia, Bacteraemia, Toxaemia, Acute adrenocortical insufficiency, Cortisosteroid-responsive dermatoses, Eczema, Urticaria, Cerebral oedema, other indications where glucocorticoid therapy is required.,

Dose: Usual oral dosage range is 0.5-10 mg daily. 

Dexamethasone can be given parenterally at doses of 0.5-20 mg daily, either as a single IV/IM injection or by IV infusion. 

Child: 200-500 mcg/kg daily. Cerebral oedema: 10 mg IV initially, then 4 mg IM every 6 hours as required for 2-10 days. Large IV doses should be given slowly to reduce the possibility of cardiovascular collapse.

Shock: By intravenous or intramascular injection or infusion 2-6 mg/kg, repeated if necessary after 2-6 hours.

The total daily intake of Dexamethasone, even in acute conditions should not exceed 80 mg except in certain very special circumstances.

Contra-indication: Ocular herpes simplex is an example of absolute contraindication to corticosteroid therapy. Relative contraindications are:
Gastrointestinal ulcer, acute or chronic infections, osteoporosis, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, hypertension, history of psychotic illness, immediate before prophylactic immunization and finally hypersensitivity to Dexamethasone.

Side effects: Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis and allergic skin reactions has been reported. The incidence of predictable undesirable effects of glucocoticoids correlates with the dosage timing of administration and duration of treatment. Patients on prolonged Dexamethasone therapy are at risk of collapse and possibly death if their daily dose is not increased at times of severe physical stress e.g. injury, surgery or infections. The somatic manifestations include growth retardation in children, osteoporosis and aseptic bone necrosis, peptic ulceration, ocular hypertension, subcapsular cataract, pancreatic disturbances and myopathy. Other Cushing-like features characteristic of glucocorticoid excess includes truncal obesity, moon-face, oedema, delayed wound healing, glaucoma and various psychiatric syndromes. These are all generally reversible with discontinuation of Dexamethasone treatment.

Precaution: Dexamethasone should be used with caution in the presence of congestive heart failure or hypertension, in patients with diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, glaucoma, infectious disease, chronic renal failure and uraemia and in elderly persons.

Mode of action: Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid which decreases inflammation by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses normal immune response.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:  	Increased risk of hypokalaemia when used concurrently with potassium-depleting drugs such as amphotericin B and loop diuretics.

Precaution: This product, like many other steroid formulations, is sensitive to heat.  Therefore, it should not be autoclaved when it is desirable to sterilize the exterior of the vial.

Following prolonged therapy, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in symptoms of the corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome including fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise.  This may occur in patients even without evidence of adrenal insufficiency.

There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids in patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis.

Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex for fear of corneal perforation.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction must be gradual.

Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression to frank psychotic manifestations.  Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids.

Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.

Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess, or other pyogenic infection, also in diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, renal insufficiency, hypertension, osteoporosis, and myasthenia gravis.  

When large doses are given, some authorities advise that antacids be administered between meals to help to prevent peptic ulcer.

Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully followed.

Steroids may increase or decrease motility and number of spermatozoa in some patients.

Phenytoin, phenobarbital, ephedrine, and rifampin may enhance the metabolic clearance of corticosteroids resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring adjustment in corticosteroid dosage.  These interactions may interfere with dexamethasone suppression tests which should be interpreted with caution during administration of these drugs.

When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting diuretics, patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia.

Intra-articular injection of a corticosteroid may produce systemic as well as local effects.








Mode of action: Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid which decreases inflammation by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses normal immune response.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:  	Increased risk of hypokalaemia when used concurrently with potassium-depleting drugs such as amphotericin B and loop diuretics. Reduces efficacy of isoniazid, salicylates, vaccines and toxoids. Increased activity of dexamethasone and cyclosporin when used together. Concurrent use with aspirin or ethanol may lead to increased GI side effects.
Potentially Fatal: Reduced efficacy in combination with ephedrine, cholestyramine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and rifampicin.ACI	Flamex DX TAB dr 300mg 50's pack 201.50 BDT

Interaction: Dextran: Enzyme inducers e.g. phenytoin or carbamazepine and enzyme inhibitors e.g. cimetidine. Sodium Chloride: May affect serum concentrations of lithium.Indication: Hypovolaemic shock, Pulmonary embolism, Venous thrombosis, Open heart surgery

Dose: DextranI/V should be administered prior to administration of clinical dextran solutions.

    In shock, it is suggested that total dosage not exceed 20 mL/kg for adults and adolescents, during the first 24 hours. The first 10 mL/kg may be infused as rapidly as necessary to effect improvement. It is strongly recommended that central venous pressure be monitored frequently during the initial infusion of the drug. Should therapy continue beyond 24 hours, subsequent dosage should not exceed 10 mL/kg per day and therapy should not continue beyond five days.

  In prophylaxis of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, the dosage  for adults and adolescents, should be chosen according to the risk of thromboembolic complications, e.g., type of surgery and duration of immobilization. In general, treatment should be initiated during surgery; 500 to 1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg of body weight) should be administered on the day of operation. Treatment should be continued at a dose of 500 mL daily for an additional two to three days; then, according to the risk of complications, 500 mL may be given every second or third day during the period of risk, for up to two weeks.

    Infants may be given 5 mL per kg body weight and children 10 mL per kg.



Contra-indication: Patients with known hypersensitivity to dextran, in those with marked hemostatic defects of all types (thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, etc.) including those caused by drugs (heparin, warfarin, etc.), marked cardiac decompensation and in renal disease with severe oliguria or anuria.

Side effects: Because of the seriousness of anaphylactoid reactions, it is recommended that the infusion of intravenous dextran be stopped at the first sign of an allergic reaction provided that other means of sustaining the circulation are available. Resuscitative measures should be readily available for emergency administration in the event such a reaction occurs. In circulatory collapse due to anaphylaxis, rapid volume substitutions with an agent other than dextran should be instituted.

Precaution: The possibility of circulatory overload should be kept in mind. Special care should be exercised in patients with impaired renal clearance of dextran. When the risk of pulmonary edema and/or congestive heart failure may be increased, dextran should be used with caution.

In patients with normal hemostasis, dosage of LMD (dextran 40) approximating 15 mL/kg of body weight may prolong bleeding time and depress platelet function. Dosages in this range also markedly decrease factor VIII, and decrease factors V and IX to a greater degree than would be expected to occur from hemodilution alone. Since these changes tend to be more pronounced following trauma or major surgery, patients should be observed for early signs of bleeding complications.

Since increased rouleaux formation may occur in the presence of dextran, it is recommended that blood samples be drawn for typing and cross-matching prior to the infusion of dextran and reserved for subsequent use if necessary. If blood is drawn after infusion of dextran, the saline agglutination and indirect antiglobulin methods may be used for typing and cross-matching. Difficulty may be encountered when proteolytic enzyme techniques are used to match blood.

Consideration should be given to withdrawal of blood for chemical laboratory tests prior to initiating therapy with dextran because of the following:

    Blood sugar determinations that employ high concentrations of acid may result in hydrolysis of dextran, yielding falsely elevated glucose assay results. This has been observed both with sulfuric acid and with acetic acid.

    In other laboratory tests, the presence of dextran in the blood may result in the development of turbidity, which can interfere with the assay. This has been observed in bilirubin assays in which alcohol is employed and in total protein assays employing biuret reagent.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions, to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. 

Mode of action: Dextrans produce expansion of plasma volume. It also reduces blood viscosity and inhibits sludging or aggregation of red blood cells.

	Indication: Dehydration, Fluid and Electrolytes imbalance

Dose: The dose is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical condition of the patient.

As reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.

If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

Precaution: Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.

Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin.

Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion.

Mode of action: Dextrose and sodium chloride solutions are used as sources of electrolytes, calories and water for hydration. Sodium and chloride ions are responsible for regulating the acid-base balance of the body. Dextrose is a source of calories. It is readily metabolised and helps to decrease losses of body protein and nitrogen. It also promotes glycogen deposition and decreases or prevents ketosis.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:Indication: Dehydration, Fluid and Electrolytes imbalance

Dose: These solutions are for intravenous use only.

Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy.

When a hypertonic solution is to be administered peripherally, it should be slowly infused through a small bore needle, placed well within the lumen of a large vein to minimize venous irritation. Carefully avoid infiltration.

In the average adult, daily requirements of sodium and chloride are met by the infusion of one liter of fluid containing 0.9% sodium chloride (154 mEq each of sodium and chloride).

Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient.

Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Contra-indication: These solutions are contraindicated where the administration of sodium or chloride could be clinically detrimental.

Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to corn products.

Side effects: Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia.

Too rapid infusion of hypertonic solutions may cause local pain and venous irritation. Rate of administration should be adjusted according to tolerance. Use of the largest peripheral vein and a small bore needle is recommended. 

Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential.

Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water, resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume. If infused in large amounts, chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.





Precaution: These solutions should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation. 

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients. Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Infusion of more than one liter of isotonic (0.9%) sodium chloride per day  can exceed normal tolerance, resulting in hypernatremia; this may also cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, resulting in an acidifying effect.

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus, or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason. Hypokalemia may develop during parenteral administration of hypertonic dextrose solutions. Sufficient amounts of potassium should be added to dextrose solutions administered to fasting patients with good renal function, especially those on digitalis therapy.

These solutions are intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Mode of action: Dextrose and sodium chloride solutions are used as sources of electrolytes, calories and water for hydration. Sodium and chloride ions are responsible for regulating the acid-base balance of the body. Dextrose is a source of calories. It is readily metabolised and helps to decrease losses of body protein and nitrogen. It also promotes glycogen deposition and decreases or prevents ketosis.

Interaction:Indication: Acute renal failure, Chronic renal failure. Peritoneal dialysis,

Dose:  Solutions are provided for intraperitoneal administration only. The mode of therapy, frequency of treatment, formulation, exchange volume, duration of dwell, and length of dialysis should be selected by the physician responsible for the treatment of the individual patient.

In case of IPD: Usually  2 litres of peritoneal dialysis solutiion is instill into the abdominal cavity and dwell over a period of an hour then drained from the cavity. Exchange should be continued for 8-36 hours.

To avoid the risk of severe dehydration or hypovolemia and to minimize the loss of protein, it is advisable to select the peritoneal dialysis solution with lowest level of osmolarity consistent with the fluid removal requirements for that exchange.

Contra-indication: Patient with excessive obesity and pregnancy.

Side effects: Adverse reactions occurring with administration of peritoneal dialysis include mechanical and solution related problems as well as the results of contamination of equipment or improper technique in catheter placement. Abdominal pain, bleeding, peritonitis, subcutaneous infection around a peritoneal catheter, catheter blockage, difficulty in fluid removal, and ileus are among the complications of the procedure. Solution related adverse reactions may include peritonitis, catheter site infection, electrolyte and fluid imbalances, hypovolemia, hypervolemia, hypertension, hypotension, disequilibrium syndrome and muscle cramping.

If an adverse reaction does occur, institute appropriate therapeutic procedures according to the patient's needs and conditions, and save the remainder of the fluid in the bag for evaluation if deemed necessary.

Precaution: Solution should not be administered unless it is clear, all seals are intact, and there is no evidence of leaking.

Care should be taken to see that the catheter is inserted completely, since leakage around the catheter, if not controlled, can create edema from subcutaneous infiltration of the dialysis solution. This will also create an inaccurate fluid balance measurement.

Chronic patients that have been stabilized on peritoneal dialysis therapy should have routine evaluation of electrolyte blood chemistries and hematologic factors measured in order to determine the patient's ongoing condition.

Mode of action: Sodium lactate is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution that is used for fluid and electrolyte replenishment. It has metabolic alkalinising ability and is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient.
Calcium chloride is used to prevent or treat negative calcium balance. It also regulates action potential excitation threshold to facilitate nerve and muscle performance.
Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives.
Magnessium Chloride: Acts as cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions involving protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism; depresses CNS, blocks peripheral neuromuscular transmission, produces anticonvulsant effects.
Dextrose is a monosaccharide that is used as a source of calories and water for hydration. It helps to reduce loss of body protein and nitrogen. It also promotes glycogen deposition in the liver. When used with insulin, it stimulates the uptake of potassium by cells, especially in muscle tissue, thus lowering serum potassium levels.

	Indication: Rheumatoid arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, Pain, Acute gout, Inflammation, Tendinitis, Actinic keratoses, Bursitis

Dose: Adults: The dosage is generally one 75 mg ampoule daily. In severe cases (e.g. colic) the daily dose can exceptionally be increased to two ampoules of 75 mg, separated by an interval of a few hours.

Children: In juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac sodium/kg body weight daily in divided doses.
Elderly patients: The lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status or as prescribed by the physician.

Contra-indication: In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibitinig activity, it is also contraindicated.

Lidocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to local anesthetics of the amide-type.

Side effects: Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.
The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly involve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are dose related. The CNS reaction may be manifested by drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, lightheadness, etc. Incase of eye drops ocular burning sensation or allergic reaction may occur in 5-10% patients. 


Precaution: History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued.

Mode of action: Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.

Lidocaine is an amide type local anaesth. It stabilises the neuronal membrane and inhibits Na ion movements, which are necessary for conduction of impulses. In the heart, lidocaine reduces depolarisation of the ventricles during diastole and automaticity in the His-Purkinje system. Duration of action potential and effective refractory period are also reduced.

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction:  	May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.
May increase serum levels w/ cimetidine and propranolol. Increased risk of cardiac depression w/ ?-blockers and other antiarrhythmics. Additive cardiac effects w/ IV phenytoin. Hypokalaemia caused by acetazolamide, loop diuretics and thiazides may antagonise effect of lidocaine. Dose requirements may be increased w/ long-term use of phenytoin and other enzyme-inducers.Acme Ltd.	A Fenac K TAB dr 50mg 50's pack 150 BDT

In migraine attacks, clinical experience is limited to initial use of 1 ampoule of 75 mg administered as soon as possible, followed by suppositories up to 100 mg on the same day if required. The total dosage should not exceed 175 mg on the first day.

Children: In juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of Diclofenac sodium/kg body weight daily in divided doses.

Elderly patients: The lowest effective dosage is recommended, commensurate with age and physical status or as prescribed by the physician.

Suppository: For adults: 50 mg suppository 2-3 times daily. Maximum daily dose is 150 mg. 

Contra-indication: It is contra-indicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to Diclofenac. In patients with active or suspected peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, or for those patients in whom attacks of asthma, urticaria or acute rhinitis are precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs possessing prostaglandin synthetase inhibitinig activity, it is also contraindicated.
Because of the presence of Lidocaine, it is also contraindicated for those patients who are hypersensitive to local anaesthetics of the amide type, although the incidence is very rare. 

Side effects: Side-effects of Diclofenac is usually mild and transient. It is generally well tolerated. At the starting of the treatment, however, patients may sometimes complain of gastrointestinal discomfort, epigastria pain, eructation, nausea and Diarrhoea, headache and bleeding sometime may occur. Occasionally skin rash, peripheral oedema and abnormalities of serum transaminase have been reported.Very rarely reported side effects include activation of peptic ulcer, haematemesis or melena, blood dyscrasia (extensive usage). There have been isolated reports of anaphylactoid reactions.


Precaution: History of gastrointestinal ulceration, haematemesis or melaena, ulcerative colitis, Asthma or history of asthma, Crohn's disease, bleeding diathesis or haematological abnormalities. Patients with severe hepatic, cardiac or renal insufficiency or the elderly people, Current or previous high blood pressure ( hypertension) should be kept under close surveillance. All patients who are receiving long-term treatment with NSAID agents should be monitored as a precautionary measure (e.g., renal, hepatic function and blood counts).If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop or if other manifestations occur, Diclofenac sodium should be discontinued. Use of Diclofenac tablet in patients with hepatic porphyria may trigger an attack.

Mode of action: Diclofenac, a phenylacetic acid derivative is a prototypical NSAID. It has potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction:  May increase serum levels of methotrexate. Concomitant use w/ other NSAIDs or anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) is associated w/ higher risk of GI bleeding. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity w/ ciclosporin or triamterene. May increase the risk of developing corneal complications in patients w/ significant pre-existing corneal inflammation when use concomitantly w/ ophth preparation containing corticosteroids. Colestyramine and colestipol reduce the bioavailability of diclofenac. Decreased plasma concentration when administered after sucralfate. Ophth application of diclofenac may reduce the efficacy of ophth acetylcholine and carbachol. May increase serum levels of lithium and digoxin.Acme Ltd.

	Indication: Chloasma, Melasma, Freckles, Senile lentigines, Hyperpigmentation

Dose: Hyperpigmentated skin conditions
Adult: Apply and rub in a thin layer  to affected area bid.

After desired bleaching, use only as needed to maintain results of treatment. After reduction of hyperpigmentation, use of sunscreen agents and/or protective clothing should continue on bleached skin to prevent repigmentation.

Contra-indication: Hydroquinone is contraindicated to patients with prior history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to hydroquinone or other ingredients in the preparation. Sunburn or depilatory usage. Children <12 yr.

Side effects: Transient erythema, mild burning sensations; hyperpigmentation. Staining and corneal opacities. Tremors and convulsions after systemic absorption. Occasionally, hypersensitivity.

Precaution: Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin to check in 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, further treatment is not advised. If no bleaching or lightening effect is noted after 2 months of treatment, the medication should be discontinued.Contact with the eyes and lips should be avoided. Hydroquinone should not be applied to cut or abraded skin. Avoid contact with eyes and on abraded or sunburnt skin. Avoid unnecessary exposure to sunlight. Limit application to area no larger than face and neck or hands and arms. Not advised to use when itching, vesicle formation, or excessive inflammation occurs. Discontinue application if there is no improvement after 2 mth of treatment.

Mode of action: Oxybenzone: Although benzophenones are primarily UV-B absorbers, oxybenzone absorbs well through UV-A II. Oxybenzone can be considered a broad-spectrum absorber. It significantly augments UV-B protection when used in a given formula. 
Hydroquinone is a topical depigmentating agent used in hyperpigmentation conditions by suppressing melanocyte metabolic processes. It also increases melanin excretion from melanocytes and prevents its production.
Aminobenzoic acid is used topically as a sunscreen. It is used to prevent sunburn, but unlikely to prevent drug-related or other photosensitivity reactions associated with UVA light.

Dose: Adult: IV Acute heart failure 2.5-10 mcg/kg, up to 0.5-40 mcg/kg according to response. 

Cardiac stress test As 1 mg/mL soln: 5 mcg/kg/min for 8 mins, increase dose at 5 mcg/kg/min until 20 mcg/kg/min, w/ each dose being infused for 8 mins before the next increase.

Because of its short half-life, Dobutamine Hydrochloride must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Following the initiation of a constant rate infusion, or upon changing the rate, a steady-state dobutamine plasma concentration is achieved within approximately 10 minutes. Thus, loading doses or bolus injections are not necessary and are not recommended. 

Recommended Dosage The rate of infusion needed to increase cardiac output has ranged from 2.5 to 10 mcg/kg/min in the majority of patients. Frequently, doses up to 20 mcg/kg/min are required for adequate haemodynamic improvement. 

The rate of administration and the duration of therapy should be adjusted according to the patient's response, The indicators are: haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and rhythm, arterial pressure, and, whenever possible, cardiac output and measurements of ventricular filling pressures and signs of pulmonary congestion. 

Concentrations up to 5,000 mg/L have been administered to humans. The final volume administered should be determined by the fluid requirements of the patient. Rather than abruptly discontinuing therapy with Dobutamine Hydrochloride, it is often advisable to decrease the dosage gradually. Rates of Infusion Based on Concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride The rates of fluid infusion that are required to deliver specific dosages are a function of the concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride in the infusate.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity; idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS).

Side effects: Increased heart rate and BP, ectopic beats, palpitation. Nausea, headache, chest pain, palpitation, dyspnoea, paraesthesia, leg cramps. Tissue necrosis at site of extravasation.

Dose: Adult: PO Initial: 5 mg/day in the evening, up to 10 mg/day after 4-6 wk. The 5 mg (1 tab)/day dose should be maintained for at least one month in order to allow the earliest clinical responses to treatment to be assessed and to allow steady-state concentrations of donepezil hydrochloride to be achieved. 

Following a one-month clinical assessment of treatment at 5 mg/day, the dose can be increased to 10 mg/day (once-a-day dosing). Since food does not affect the rate or extent of absorption of donepezil, it can be administered with or without food. 

In case of renal & hepatic impairment: A similar dose schedule can be followed for patients with renal or mild to moderate hepatic impairment as clearance of donepezil hydrochloride is not affected by these conditions. 

In case of children: There are no adequate and well controlled trials in document to safety and efficacy of donepezil hydrochloride in any illness occurring in children. Donepezil is not recommended for use in children.


Contra-indication: Donepezil is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to donepezil hydrochloride or to piperidine derivatives.

Side effects: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, wt loss, diarrhoea, insomnia, fatigue, muscle cramps; headache and dizziness; syncope, bradycardia; convulsions; increased liver transaminases; sinoatrial and atrioventricular block; hallucinations, agitation and aggressive behavior; minor increases in plasma creatine kinase; potentially bladder outflow obstruction.

Precaution: Caution when used in patients with sick sinus syndrome or cardiac conduction abnormalities. May increase secretion of gastric acid; caution when used in patients at risk of ulcer disease. Patients with COPD, asthma, history of epilepsy, bladder obstruction, prostatic hypertrophy. May cause dose-related diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomiting which usually resolves after 1-3 wk. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Pregnancy, lactation.

Mode of action: Donepezil reversibly and noncompetitively inhibits centrally-active acetylcholinesterase. It is used for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: May increase the neurotoxic effect of antipsychotics. Concurrent use with systemic corticosteroids may increase the adverse effects of donepezil. May increase the neuromuscular-blocking effect of succinylcholine. May increase the adverse effects of cholinergic agonists.

	Indication: Hypertension, Heart failure, Congestive heart failure, Left ventricular dysfunction, Acute myocardial infarction

Dose: Adult: PO CHF Post-MI Initial: 25 mg once daily; titrate to recommended dose of 50 mg once daily w/in 4 wk as tolerated. Adjust dose based on serum potassium level; reduce or w/draw therapy if hyperkalaemia develops. 

HTN Initial: 50 mg once daily; may increase to 50 mg twice daily based on response. Initiate at lower dose of 25 mg once daily if used concurrently w/ moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Contra-indication: For all patients: Serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L at initiation; CrCl ?30 mL/min; concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir). For patients treated for hypertension: Patients with type 2 DM with microalbuminuria; serum creatinine >2 mg/dL (male), or >1.8 mg/dL (female); CrCl <50 mL/min; concomitant use of potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride, spironolactone, or triamterene).

Side effects: Hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, cough, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, abnormal vaginal bleeding, gynaecomastia, mastodynia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, albuminuria, increased creatinine, elevated liver enzymes, increased uric acid, rash and angioneurotic oedema.

Precaution: Measure serum potassium levels before starting therapy, within the first wk, and periodically thereafter. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia in patients with impaired renal functions; diabetic patients with CHF post-MI (especially those with proteinuria); or concurrent use of agents affecting the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Safety and efficacy not established in patients with severe hepatic impairment; or paediatric patients <18 yr. Elderly. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g. kidney, GI tract) and nonepithelial (e.g. heart, blood vessels, brain) tissues; causing increases in blood pressure by inducing sodium reabsorption, vascular remodeling, water retention and possibly other mechanisms. Eplerenone is a relatively selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, blocking binding of aldosterone and reducing blood pressure. Eplerenone also appears to have cardioprotective effect in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) after myocardial infarction (MI).

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Concomitant use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, clarithromycin, diltiazem saquinavir, verpamil, ritonavir) may increase serum concentrations of Eplerenone. CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) may decrease Eplerenone efficacy. Eplerenone may enhance hyperkalaemic effect of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium salts. Concomitant use with diazoxide, MAOIs, pentoxifylline, prostacyclin analogues may enhance hypotensive effect of antihypertensives. NSAIDs may possibly reduce the antihypertensive and/or diuretic effects of potassium-sparing diuretics and may increase risk of hyperkalaemia. Lithium toxicity has been reported when used with ACE inhibitors or diuretics; monitor lithium levels when used with Eplerenone.Cilag AG, Switzerland	EPREX Injection 2000IU/0.5ml pre-filled syringe x 1's 1524.90 BDT

immediately. In case of anaphylactic shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be
implemented. 

Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose malabsorption or
sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.

Mode of action: The mechanism of action includes the binding of factor VIIa to exposed tissue factor. This complex activates factor IX into factor IXa and factor X into factor Xa, leading to the initial conversion of small amounts of prothrombin into thrombin.
Thrombin leads to the activation of platelets and factors V and VIII at the site of injury and to the formation of the haemostatic plug by converting fibrinogen into fibrin.

Mode of action: Ergometrine causes contraction of the uterine muscle. At low doses, there is an increase in frequency and amplitude of contractions while at higher doses, the basal tone of the uterus is increased. Ergometrine also causes vasoconstriction of peripheral and cerebral vessels.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction:  	Halothane causes relaxation of uterine muscle and may interfere with ergometrine action. Enhanced uterotonic effect with prostaglandins and oxytocin. Concurrent admin with CYP3A4 inhibitors may lead to vasospasm, cerebral ischaemia and/or ischaemia of extremities.
Potentially Fatal: Enhanced vasoconstrictive effects with sympathomimetics and other vasoconstrictors.Beacon	Erlonix TAB dr 100mg 1's pack 600 BDT

	Indication: Small cell lung cancer, Pancreatic cancer

Dose: Adult: PO Locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung carcinoma 150 mg once daily. Locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer W/ gemcitabine: 100 mg/day. Dose modifications may be required when used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers; or in cigarette smoking patients.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Adverse reactions reported with monotherapy: Fatigue, diarrhoea, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, stomatitis, weight loss, rash, pruritus, acne, dermatitis acneiform, dry skin, cough, dyspnoea, infection, conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis sicca, liver function test abnormalities. Adverse reactions reported when used with gemcitabine: Fatigue, rash, nausea, anorexia, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight decreased, infection, oedema, pyrexia, constipation, bone pain, dyspnoea, stomatitis, myalgia, depression, dyspepsia, cough, dizziness, headache, insomnia, alopecia, anxiety, neuropathy, flatulence, rigors.

Precaution: Pregnancy and lactation. Interrupt Erlotinib therapy if patient develops unexplained pulmonary symptoms e.g. dyspnoea, cough, fever; discontinue therapy if interstitial lung disease is diagnosed. Monitor liver functions periodically; extreme caution is needed if total bilirubin is 3x >ULN; close monitoring is required in patients with hepatic impairment. Interrupt/discontinue therapy if severe changes in liver functions (doubling of total bilirubin and/or tripling of transaminases) occur. Interrupt therapy in the event of dehydration especially in patients with predisposing factors to renal failure. Monitor renal function and serum electrolytes in patients at risk of dehydration. Interrupt or discontinue therapy if patient develops severe bullous and exfoliative skin disorders; eye pain or other acute/worsening ocular disorders. If patient develops GI perforation, discontinue therapy permanently. Patients with CV disorders. Monitor prothrombin time/INR in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants.

Mode of action: Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (EGFR/HER1) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It reversibly inhibits the kinase activity of EGFR, preventing autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues associated w/ the receptor, thereby inhibiting further downstream signaling and resulting in cell death.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Increased serum levels w/ potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir). CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) may reduce exposure of erlotinib. Increased serum levels w/ potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacin) or capecitabine. Use w/ P-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g. ciclosporin, verapamil) may cause altered distribution or elimination of erlotinib. Drugs that increase the pH of the GI tract (e.g. antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, or PPIs) may reduce the solubility of erlotinib thus lowering its bioavailability. Concomitant use w/ warfarin or other coumarin derivates may increase INR and bleeding events.Indication: Intra-abdominal infections, Community-acquired pneumonia, Skin and skin structure infections, Urinary tract infections, Pyelonephritis, Surgical infections, Diabetic foot infections, Septic abortion

Dose: Adult: IV Surgical prophylaxis 1 g as a single dose, 1 hr before start of procedure. IV/IM Susceptible infections 1 g once daily.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity; lactation.

Side effects: GI effects, injection-site reactions, raised platelet count; less frequently dry mouth, taste disturbances; hypotension, chest pain, oedema, pharyngeal discomfort, dyspnoea, dizziness, sleep disturbances, confusion, asthenia, seizures, vaginitis, raised glucose; headache; hypersensitivity reactions; antibiotic-associated colitis; dysphagia, cholecystitis; liver disorder; arrhythmia; increase in blood pressure; syncope; nasal congestion; cough; wheezing; CNS effects; pelvic peritonitis; renal impairment; muscle cramp, scleral disorder; blood disorders, hypoglycaemia; electrolyte disturbances. Local site reactions such as pain and thrombophlebitis may occur.
Potentially Fatal: Pseudomembranous colitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Precaution: Hypersensitivity to penicillins, cephalosporins or other beta-lactams (possibility of cross-sensitivity). Renal impairment; CNS disorders e.g. epilepsy. Pregnancy.

Mode of action: Ertapenem acts similarly to penicillins by bacterial cell wall inhibition. It is active against many gram-negative and aerobic and anaerobic organisms. It is stable to hydrolysis by ?-lactamases.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: May decrease plasma levels of valproic acid thus, increasing the risk of seizures. Increased plasma concentrations w/ probenecid.ACI	Erythin Powder for Suspension 125mg/5ml 100ml bot 61.47 BDT

	Indication: Anemia associated with Chronic Renal Failure, including patients on dialysis (ESRD) and patients not on dialysis, Anemia in patients with non-myeloid malignancies where anemia is due to the effect of concomitantly administered chemotherapy, Anemic patients (hemoglobin > 10 to < 13 g/dL) scheduled to undergo elective, noncardiac, nonvascular surgery to reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusions, Anemia related to therapy with zidovudine in HIV-infected patients.

Dose: Treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure: Erythropoietin is administered to maintain hemoglobin concentration between 11 to 12 g/dl and hematocrit of 33 -36 % in adults.

Starting dose:
Adult: usually 50 to 100 IU/kg three times in a week (TIW) by IV or Subcutaneous route
Pediatric: 50 IU/kg TIW by IV or Subcutaneous route

Dose adjustment: Dose should be increased if hematocrit doses not increase by 5 to 6 points after 8 weeks therapy, and hematocrit is below suggested target range. Dose should be reduced when hematocrit approaches 36% or hematocrit increases >4 points in any 2-week period.

Maintenance dose: Maintenance dose must be individualized for each patient. In patients undergoing dialysis, the median maintenance dose is 75 IU/kg TIW, with a range from 12.5 to 525 IU/kg TIW as directed by the physician. In CRF patients not on dialysis, maintenance dose is 75 to 150 IU/kg/week.

Treatment of Anemia in Cancer Patients on Chemotherapy
Starting dose:
Adult: 150 IU/kg TIW by Subcutaneous route or 40,000 IU Subcutaneous route weekly
Pediatric: 25 to 300 IU/kg 3 to 7 times per week by Subcutaneous or IV route

Dose adjustment: If the response is not satisfactory, the dose should be increased to 300 IU/kg TIW. If the hematocrit exceeds 40%, the dose should be withheld until the hematocrit falls to 36%. The dose should be reduced to 25% when treatment is resumed and titrated to maintain the desired hematocrit.

The recommended dose is 300 IU/kg/day subcutaneously for 10 days before surgery, on the day of surgery, and for 4 days after surgery. An alternate dose schedule is 600 IU/kg subcutaneously in once weekly dose (21, 14, and 7 days before surgery) plus a fourth dose on the day of surgery.

Zidovudine-treated HIV-infected Patients
Starting dose:
Adult: 100 IU/kg as an IV or Subcutaneous injection TIW for 8 weeks
Pediatric: 50 to 400 IU/kg 2 to 3 times per week by Subcutaneous or IV route

Dose adjustment: If the response is not satisfactory, the dose should be increased by 50-100 IU/kg TIW. Response should be evaluated every 4 to 8 weeks thereafter and the dose adjusted accordingly by 50 to 100 IU/kg increments TIW.

Maintenance dose: The dose is titrated to maintain the hematocrit between 33-36%.

Contra-indication: Uncontrolled hypertension, hypersensitivity to mammalian cell products and human albumin.

Side effects: General: Headache, dizziness, fever, malaise, arthralgia and occasionally hyperkalemia CVS: Hypertension is the most common side effect, palpitations. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia and diarrhea may occur occasionally. Allergic reactions.Potentially Fatal: Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms e.g. headache, confusion, generalised seizures. Thrombosis.

Precaution: Erythropoietin should be used with caution in those patients with controlled hypertension, ischaemic vascular disease, history of seizures, or suspected allergy to the product. Iron evaluation: Prior to and during Epoetin therapy, the patient's iron stores, including transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be evaluated. Transferrin saturation should be at least 20%, and ferritin should be at least 100 ng/mL. Virtually all patients will require supplemental iron to increase or maintain transferrin saturation to levels that will adequately support erythropoiesis.

Mode of action: Erythropoietin regulates erythropoiesis by stimulating the differentiation and proliferation of erythroid precursors, stimulating the release of reticulocytes into the circulation, and synthesis of cellular haemoglobin. Recombinant human erythropoietin is available as epoetin alfa and epoetin beta which are used in the management of anaemias associated with CRF, cancer chemotherapy and anti-AIDS drug zidovudine.

	Indication: Major depressive disorder, Depression, Panic disorder, Obsessive compulsive disorder, Anxiety disorder

Dose: Adult: PO Depression; Anxiety; Obsessive compulsive disorder 10 mg once daily. Max: 20 mg/day. 
Panic disorder Initial: 5 mg/day, up to 10 mg/day after 7 days if needed. Max: 20 mg/day.

Elderly: Half the adult dose.
Hepatic impairment: Dosage adjustments may be required. 

Contra-indication: Concomitant use with or within 2 wk of MAOI withdrawal.

Side effects: Nausea, diarrhoea, increased sweating, insomnia, impotence, ejaculation disorder, fatigue, somnolence; postural hypotension, sinusitis, taste disturbances. Increased appetite and wt gain.

Precaution: History of mania or seizure disorders; work requiring mental alertness; renal and hepatic impairment; pregnancy, lactation; withdraw gradually. Children and adolescents <18 yr

Mode of action: Escitalopram selectively inhibits CNS neuronal re-uptake of serotonin (5-HT) and potentiates serotonergic activity. It has minimal effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal re-uptake.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased risk of bleeding when used with aspirin, NSAIDs or drugs that affect coagulation. Serum levels may be reduced by CYP2C19 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin) or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. nafcillin, nevirapine). Serum levels may also be increased by CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, fluvoxamine, omeprazole) or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, clarithromycin). May increase serum levels of desipramine or metoprolol. Increased risk of serotonin syndrome when used with linezolid or sibutramine. Escitalopram may enhance the sedative effects of alcohol.
Potentially Fatal: Concomitant administration with MAOIs may lead to serious or fatal reactions; should not be started until at least 2 wk after stopping escitalopram or vice versa. Moclobemide may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.Square	Eslicar TAB dr 400mg 10's pack  BDT
	Indication: Partial-onset seizures

Dose: Adult: PO: The recommended starting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two weeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily.

Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been established.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients. Second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

Side effects: Allergic reactions: May cause serious skin rash or other serious allergic reactions
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) side effects are:
• Feeling dizzy or sleepy.
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) side effects are:
• Feeling unsteady or having a sensation of spinning or floating;
• Feeling sick or vomiting;
• Headache;
• Diarrhoea;
• Seeing double or blurred vision;
• Difficulty in concentration;
• Feeling low in energy or tired;
• Shaking;
• Skin rash;
• Blood tests showing that you have low levels of sodium in your blood;
• Decrease of appetite;
• Difficulty in sleeping;
• Difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia).

Precaution: Suicidal ideation
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic active substances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.
Nervous system disorders
Eslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.
Oral contraceptives
Eslicarbazepine acetate may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended
Other warnings and precautions
If Eslicarbazepine is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential of increased seizure frequency.
Concomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may cause overexposure to the active metabolites.
Hyponatraemia
Hyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of patients treated with Eslicarbazepine. Hyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms like worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia increased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease leading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may themselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels should be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum sodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium levels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant hyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued.
PR interval
Prolongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.
Caution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac conduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation.
Renal impairment
Caution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance. In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is not recommended due to insufficient data.
Hepatic impairment
As clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic and clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.


Mode of action: Antiepileptic drug; eslicarbazepine acetate is a prodrug that is activated to eslicarbazepine (S-licarbazepine), the major active metabolite of oxcarbazepine.

Stabilizes neuronal membranes by blocking Na+ channels; this may inhibit repetitive firing and may decrease the propagation of synaptic impulses; may also increase potassium conductance and modulate the activity of high-voltage activated calcium channels.

	Indication: Insomnia

Dose: Oral
Insomnia
Adult: Initial: 2 mg immediately before bedtime. If clinically indicated, may initiate treatment at or increase dosage to 3 mg immediately before bedtime.
Elderly: Difficulty falling asleep: Initial: 1 mg immediately before bedtime; may increase to 2 mg at bedtime if clinically indicated. Difficulty staying asleep: 2 mg immediately before bedtime. Dosages exceeding 2 mg daily are not recommended.
Hepatic impairment: Severe hepatic impairment: Initial: 1 mg immediately before bedtime. Dosages exceeding 2 mg daily are not recommended.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity

Side effects: Headache, dizziness, somnolence, nervousness, depression, confusion, hallucination, anxiety, abnormal dreams, pain, migraine, neuralgia, rash, pruritus, dry mouth, unpleasant taste, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, peripheral oedema, chest pain, urinary tract infection, viral infection, dysmenorrhoea, gynecomastia, decreased libido, dyspnoea, agitation, and memory impairment.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylaxis reactions, angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx.

Precaution: Initiate treatment only after careful evaluation of patients; failure of insomnia to remit after 7-10 days of treatment may indicate presence of primary psychiatric and/or medical illness requiring evaluation. May be associated with abnormal thoughts and behaviour changes e.g. bizarre behavior, agitation, hallucinations, depersonalization, decreased inhibition. Complex sleep-related behaviours with no memory of the incident such as "sleep-driving", preparing and eating food, making phone calls, having sex while not fully awake have been reported. Caution in patients with history of drug or alcohol dependence and/or abuse. Worsening of depression, emergence of suicidality have been reported. Eszopiclone has rapid onset of action and must be taken immediately before bedtime or after experiencing difficulty sleeping. May impair ability to drive or operate machinery. Hypersensitivity reaction including angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx, and symptoms suggestive of anaphylaxis have been reported. Abrupt discontinuance or rapid dose reduction may cause withdrawal symptoms. Caution in hepatic impairment; elderly/debilitated patients. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children <18 yr. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Eszopiclone is an S-enantiomer of zopiclone; a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic of the cyclopyrrolone class. It is structurally unrelated to pyrazolopyrimidines, imidazopyridines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other known drugs with similar hypnotic activity. The exact mechanism of action is unknown, its effect is associated with the interaction with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-receptor complex at binding domains found near to or allosterically coupled to benzodiazepine receptors.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) may decrease metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of Eszopiclone; dosage reduction of Eszopiclone may be needed. Concurrent use with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin) may reduce concentrations of Eszopiclone. 

May enhance adverse CNS effects when used with alcohol, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, or other psychotropic drugs. Concurrent use with flumazenil may diminish the sedative effect of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics.Ambee	Sural TAB dr 400mg 100's pack 166 BDT

Child: For treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis: 15-25 mg/kg daily or 50 mg/kg twice wkly. For congenitally acquired tuberculosis: Neonates: 15 mg/kg once daily and >1 mth: 15 mg/kg once daily or 30 mg/kg 3 times wkly for 2 mth initial treatment phase. 

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity; optic neuritis. Lactation.

Side effects: Retrobulbar neuritis with a reduction in visual acuity, constriction of visual field, central or peripheral scotoma and green-red colour blindness. Retinal haemorrhage (rare); reduced renal clearance of urates (acute gout); GI disturbances eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia; rash, headache, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, malaise, jaundice; thrombocytopenia; pulmonary infiltrates.

Precaution: Impaired pre-treatment visual acuity, elderly, children. Perform liver, kidney and visual acuity tests regularly. Caution when assessing visual acuity in patients with cataracts, DM, recurrent eye inflammation to make sure that changes are not due to the underlying causes.

Mode of action: Ethambutol interferes with RNA synthesis, causing suppression of Mycobacteria multiplication. It also has bacteriostatic action against M tuberculosis by acting on rapidly growing pathogens in cavity walls and is also effective in slow-growing pathogens. Has some action against atypical opportunistic Mycobacteria e.g. M kansasii, M avium complex (MAC).

Interaction:  	Delayed or reduced absorption w/ Al hydroxide.Novartis (Bangladesh) Ltd.	Rimstar 4- FDC TAB dr   50's pack 500 BDT
	Indication: Tuberculosis

Dose: Rimstar 4-FDC presents- Rifampicin 150mg + Isoniazid 75mg + Pyrazinamide 400mg + Ethambutol 275mg tablet. Patients should be given the following single daily dose of either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.

The total dosage requirement of rifampicin is 10 (8 to 12) mglkg/day, of isoniazid 5 (4 to 6) mglkglday, of pyrazinamide 25 (20 to 30) mglkg/day and of ethambutol 15 (15-20) mglkg/day.

New patients:
Body weight < 50kg, initial 2•months- Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily; next 4 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 450mg + Isoniazid 300mg daily.

Body weight >50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily; next 4 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 600mg + Isoniazid 300mg at a time daily.

Re-treatment patients:
Body weight < 50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily, & Streptomycin 15mg/kg daily; next 1 month Rimstar 4-FDC 3 tablets at a time daily; next 5 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 450mg + Isoniazid 300mg daily, & Ethambutol 400mg 2 tablets (800mg) at a time daily.

Body weight >50kg, initial 2 months- Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily, & Streptomycin 15mg/kg daily; next 1 month Rimstar 4-FDC 4 tablets at a time daily; next 5 months- continuation dose Rifampicin 600mg + Isoniazid 300mg at a time daily, & Ethambutol 400mg 2 1/2 tablets (1000mg) at a time daily.


Contra-indication: Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide or any of the components, or to any of the rifamycins. 

Side effects: No serious adverse events were reported in the patients receiving   tablets. Three serious adverse events were reported in the patients given isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide as separate tablets and capsules. The three serious adverse events were two general hypersensitivity reactions and one jaundice reaction.

Precaution: For treatment of tuberculosis, rifampin is usually administered on a daily basis. Doses of rifampin (>600 mg) given once or twice weekly have resulted in a higher incidence of adverse reactions, including the "flu syndrome" (fever, chills and malaise); hematopoietic reactions (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or acute hemolytic anemia); cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and hepatic reactions; shortness of breath; shock, anaphylaxis, and renal failure. Recent studies indicate that regimens using twice-weekly doses of rifampin 600 mg plus isoniazid 15 mg/kg are much better tolerated.

Rifampin is not recommended for intermittent therapy; the patient should be cautioned against intentional or accidental interruption of the daily dosage regimen since rare renal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported when therapy was resumed in such cases.

Mode of action: Rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide are all active bactericidal antituberculosis drugs. Rifampicin and isoniazid are particularly active against the rapidly growing extracellular organisms and have an intracellular bactericidal activity. Rifampicin also inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells and it has activity against slow and intermittently-growing M tuberculosis. 

Pyrazinamide, particularly in the acid pH environment of macrophages is active against intracellular organisms. Combination of these agents covers activity against the 3 different bacterial populations.

Ethambutol interferes with RNA synthesis, causing suppression of Mycobacteria multiplication. It also has bacteriostatic action against M tuberculosis by acting on rapidly growing pathogens in cavity walls and is also effective in slow-growing pathogens. Has some action against atypical opportunistic Mycobacteria e.g. M kansasii, M avium complex (MAC).

May increase risk of cervical carcinoma. May affect glucose tolerance. Efficacy of oral contraceptive may be reduced in the event of severe diarrhoea or vomiting. Lactation.

Mode of action: Gestodene is a progestogen while ethinylestradiol is a synthetic oestrogen. Used together, they inhibit ovulation by suppressing the mid-cycle surge of luteinising hormone which causes changes in the cervical mucus, thus forming a barrier to sperm, and making the endometrium unreceptive to implantation.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Concurrent use with hepatic enzyme inducers e.g. barbiturates, primidone, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, phenylbutazone, rifampicin, carbamazepine and griseofulvin may affect contraceptive efficacy. Short courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics may also reduce the efficacy of the oral contraceptive. Concurrent use with HIV protease and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors may affect hepatic metabolism of gestodene and/or ethinylestradiol. May increase plasma concentrations of ciclosporin and decrease the serum levels of lamotrigine. Concurrent use with felbamate may increase the clearance of gestodene. Gestodene may increase serum levels of buprenorphine. Co-trimoxazole, miconazole and etoricoxib may increase serum levels of ethinylestradiol. Aprepitant, modafinil and bosentan may reduce the serum levels of ethinylestradiol. Metabolism of omeprazole may be inhibited by ethinylestradiol.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, lactation.

Side effects: Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, stomatitis; reversible alopoecia; rarely, disturbances of liver dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, CNS effects, anaphylactoid reactions; hypotension with IV injection. Local irritation and thrombophloebitis at the site of inj.
Potentially Fatal: Severe myelosuppression, characterised by leucopaenia and thrombocytopaenia. Cardiotoxicity. Anaphylaxis.

Precaution: Skin reactions may occur with accidental exposure; renal or hepatic disease. Periodic CBCs should be done before, during and after therapy. Increased risk of etoposide-toxicity in patients with low serum albumin. Acrylic material has been shown to crack and leak when used with undiluted etoposide inj.

Mode of action: Etoposide is a derivative of podophyllotoxin that inhibits DNA synthesis resulting in the arrest of the cell cycle. At low doses, it inhibits cells from entering cell cycle and at high doses, cells entering mitosis are lysed.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Synergism with other cytotoxic drugs. Caution when admin with drugs that inhibit phosphatase activity. Cyclosporin A may reduce the clearance of etoposide.ACI	Coxia TAB dr 120mg 20's pack 281.80 BDT

Dose: PO: Advanced HR+ BC, advanced PNET, advanced RCC, or renal angiomyolipoma with TSC:
10 mg once daily with or without food

Contra-indication: Patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other rapamycin derivatives, or to any of the excipients. Hypersensitivity reactions manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain, or angioedema (e.g., swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) have been observed with everolimus and other rapamycin derivatives

Side effects: Management of severe or intolerable adverse reactions may require temporary dose reduction and/or interruption of  therapy. If dose reduction is required, the suggested dose is approximately 50% lower than the daily dose previously administered [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

Table 1 summarizes recommendations for dose reduction, interruption or discontinuation of  in the management of adverse reactions. General management recommendations are also provided as applicable. Clinical judgment of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.

Precaution: Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives,   . Non-infectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated  in clinical trials. The incidence of Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade 3 and 4 non-infectious pneumonitis was up to 4.0% and up to 0.2%, respectively 

Mode of action: Everolimus, a proliferation signal inhibitor, prevents allograft rejection in rodent and nonhuman primate models of allotransplantation. It exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting the proliferation and thus, clonal expansion, of antigen-activated T cells which is driven by T cell-specific interleukins eg, interleukin-2 and interleukin-15. Everolimus inhibits an intracellular signaling pathway that normally leads to cell proliferation when triggered by the binding of these T cell growth factors to their receptors. The blockage of this signal by everolimus causes cells to be arrested at the G1 stage of the cell cycle.

At the molecular level, everolimus forms a complex with the cytoplasmic protein FKBP-12. In the presence of everolimus, the growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase is inhibited. Since p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation is under the control of FRAP (also called m-TOR), this finding suggests that the everolimus-FKBP-12 complex binds to and thus, interferes with the function of FRAP. FRAP is a key regulatory protein which governs cell metabolism, growth and proliferation; disabling FRAP function thus explains the cell cycle arrest caused by everolimus.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: CYP3A4 inhibitors &/or inducers, CYP2D6 substrates w/ narrow therapeutic index, PgP inhibitors, rifampicin, ACE inhibitors, grapefruit juice & live vaccines.Indication: Breast cancer in postmenopausal women

Dose: Adult: PO 25 mg once daily.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity. Premenopausal women. Pregnancy and lactation.

Side effects: Hot flushes; nausea; fatigue; increased sweating; dizziness; headache; insomnia; skin rash; abdominal pain; anorexia, vomiting (less frequently), dyspepsia, depression, alopoecia, peripheral oedema, constipation, dyspepsia. Rarely thrombocytopaenia, leucopaenia.

Precaution: Hepatic and renal impairment. Monitor bone mineral density at regular intervals especially in patients at risk of osteoporosis.

Mode of action: Exemestane is an irreversible selective aromatase inhibitor which acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme, forming an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site causing its inactivation. It also lowers circulating oestrogens in estrogen-dependent breast carcinoma.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: May result in reduced plasma levels of exemestane when used with CYP3A4 enzyme inducers. Oestrogen-containing drugs; St. John's wort, black cohosh, dong quai.Beximco	Ezeta TAB dr 10mg 20's pack 200.80 BDT

	Indication: Hyperlipidaemias, Homozygous familial sitosterolaemia, Hypercholesterolaemia

Dose: Adult: PO Homozygous familial sitosterolaemia; Hyperlipidaemias 10 mg once daily.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity; moderate to severe liver disease or unexplained serum transaminase elevation. Children <10 yr, lactation.

Side effects: Abdominal discomfort, headache, dizziness, sinusitis, pharyngitis; diarrhoea, chest pain, arthralgia, myalgia, resp infection and fatigue.

Precaution: Renal or mild hepatic impairment. Monitor LFTs. Immediately discontinue ezetimibe and any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or fibrate if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Exclude or treat secondary causes of dyslipidaemia prior to initiating therapy.

Mode of action: Ezetimibe localises at the brush border of the small intestine where it inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, thus decreasing its delivery to the liver. This results in decrease in cholesterol stores within the liver and an increase in cholesterol clearance from the blood.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Reduced absorption w/ colestyramine. Increased plasma concentrations w/ ciclosporin. Concomitant use w/ oral anticoagulants may result in increased INR.Indication: Haemophilia B

Dose: Adult: IV Replacement therapy in haemophilia B Dosage is individualised dependng on the preparation used, severity of the disease and type of surgery. Suggested target factor IX concentrations: To be raised to 20-30% of normal for mild-moderate haemorrhage; 30-60% of normal for more serious haemorrhage or minor surgery and 60-100% of normal for severe haemorrhage or major surgery. Prophylaxis in severe haemophilia B 20-40 IU/kg every 3-4 days as needed.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to mouse or hamster protein.

Side effects: Nausea and vomiting, headache, and flushing particularly after rapid infusion. Hypersensitivity reactions such as chills and urticaria.
Potentially Fatal: Severe allergic reactions.

Precaution: Caution when used in patients at risk of thromboembolism or disseminated intravascular coagulation. May cause increased risk of intravascular coagulation and thrombosis in patients with hepatic impairment. Risk of viral infection transmission as factor IX complex is a plasma-derived product. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B are recommended in haemophilic patients. Safety and efficacy have not been demostrated in patients < 16 yr. Pregnancy.

Mode of action: Factor IX is used as replacement therapy in patients with haemophilia B whereby there is a genetic deficiency of factor IX.

	Indication: Haemophilia A, Haemorrhage 

Dose: Adult: IV Replacement therapy in patients w/ haemophilia A Dosage is individualised based on coagulation test results. Recommended doses vary according to preparation used. 

Suggested doses: Mild-moderate haemorrhage (increase to 20-30% of normal): 10-15 u/kg as a single dose; 

More serious haemorrhage or minor surgery (increase to 30-50% of normal): Initial: 15-25 u/kg followed by 10-15 u/kg 8-12 hrly if required; severe haemorrhage or major surgery (increase to 80-100% of normal): Initial: 40-50 u/kg followed by 20-25 u/kg 8-12 hrly. Refer to individual product information for further dosing details. 

Prophylaxis in severe haemophilia A 10-50 u/kg every 2-3 days, as needed.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity

Side effects: Allergic reactions e.g. chills, chest tightness, fever, headache, hyperfibrinogenaemia, jittery feeling, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, stinging at infusion site, stomach discomfort, tingling, urticaria, vasomotor reactions with rapid infusion.

Precaution: Risk of intravascular haemolysis in patients with blood groups A, B, or AB receiving high doses or repeated doses of factor VIII preparations. Risk of transmission of some viral infections especially hepatitis B and C. Dose requirement may vary in patients with factor VIII inhibitors; thus optimal treatment should be based on clinical response. Monitor platelet counts regularly during treatment. Pregnancy, lactation.

Mode of action: Factor VIII is required for clot formation and maintenance of haemostasis. It activates factor X in conjunction with activated factor IX. Activated factor X then converts prothrombin to thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and forms a stable clot with factor XIII. Factor VIII is used for replacement therapy in patients with haemophilia A.

Precaution: Renal impairment. Pregnancy.

Mode of action: Famciclovir rapidly undergoes biotransformation to penciclovir, which has inhibitory activity against HSV types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Thymidine kinase then phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form, which is then converted to penciclovir triphosphate. This inhibits HSV-2 DNA polymerase by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate, thus inhibiting herpes viral DNA synthesis and replication.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Reduced renal excretion resulting to increased plasma concentration w/ probenecid. Raloxifen may reduce the formation of penciclovir, the active metabolite of famciclovir.ACI	Novatac TAB dr 20mg 100's pack 225 BDT

Interaction:Beximco	Hemofix TAB dr 275mg 30's pack 120 BDT
	Indication: Iron deficiency anemia

Dose: One capsule daily. In more severe cases, 2 capsules a day may be required or as directed by the physician.


Contra-indication: Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.

Side effects: Generally well tolerated. However, a few allergic reactions may be seen.

Precaution: Care should be taken in patients who may develop iron overload, such as those with haemochromatosis, haemolytic anaemia or red cell aplasia. Iron chelates with tetracycline and absorption may be impaired.

Mode of action: Ferrous ascorbate is a synthetic molecule of ascorbic acid and iron. Ferrous ascorbate is a stable complex of iron and ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid plays an important role in movement of plasma iron to storage depots in tissues. There is also evidence that ascorbic acid improves iron utilization, by its reducing action and it may have direct effect on erythropoiesis. This molecule doesn’t dissociate on entering GI Tract due to the stable chelate of iron with ascorbate. There is no action of food inhibitors on it as the complex does not dissociate. Ascorbate is a reducing agent and prevents oxidation. Thus maintains iron in highly soluble ferrous form.

	Indication: Iron, Zinc & Folic acid deficiency

Dose: One capsule daily. In more severe cases, 2 capsules a day may be required or as directed by the physician.


Contra-indication: Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients

Side effects: Generally well tolerated. However, a few allergic reactions may be seen.

Precaution: Care should be taken in patients who may develop iron overload, such as those with haemochromatosis, haemolytic anaemia or red cell aplasia. Iron chelates with tetracycline and absorption may be impaired.

Mode of action: Iron: Essential component in the formation of hemoglobin; adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropoiesis; also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport. Replacement of iron stores found in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and enzymes; works to transport oxygen via hemoglobin.
Folic acid: Required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis; folic acid is converted in the liver and plasma to its metabolically active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, by dihydrofolate reductase; prevents neural tube defects in women of childbearing potential and higher doses required during pregnancy.
Zinc: Cofactor in over 100 enzymes; plays a role in DNA synthesis; supports a healthy immune system; helps maintain a sense of smell and taste; may assist in porper function of insulin.

Dose: Cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy: The recommended starting dose of Filgrastim is 5 mcg/kg/day. Doses may be increased in increments of 5 mcg/kg for each chemotherapy cycle. 

Cancer patients receiving bone marrow transplant: The recommended dose of Filgrastim following bone marrow transplantation is 10 mcg/kg/day. During the period of neutrophil recovery, the daily dose should be titrated against the neutrophil response as follows: 

Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): Dose adjustment ANC>1000/mm3 for consecutive 3 days Reduces to 5 mcg/kg/day. Then, If ANC remains >1000/mm3 for consecutive 3 days Discontinue drug. Then, If ANC remains <1000/mm3 for consecutive 3 days Resume at 5 mcg/kg/day. 

Patients with chronic neutropenia: The recommended daily starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day in idiopathic neutropenia. 

Peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy: The recommended starting dose is 10 mcg/kg/day. Dose may be adjusted as required. 

HIV infection and persistent neutropenia Initial: 1 mcg/kg/day, up to 4 mcg/kg/day until neutrophil count is normalized. Maintenance: 300 mcg/day. Max: 4 mcg/kg/day.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to E. coli derived proteins, Filgrastim or any component of the product. Myeloid malignancies. Not to be used within 24 hr of cytotoxic chemotherapy admin due to the sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells. Severe congenital neutropaenia (Kostman's syndrome) with abnormal cytogenetics.

Side effects: Musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, hypersensitivity reactions, splenic rupture, acute respiratory distress syndrome, alveolar hemorrhage and haemoptysis, sickle cell crisis, splenic enlargement, hepatomegaly, thrombocytopaenia, anaemia, epistaxis, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, urinary abnormalities (dysuria, proteinuria, haematuria), osteoporosis, exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis, transient decrease in blood glucose, raised uric acid, cutaneous vasculitis, transient hypotension.Potentially Fatal: Pulmonary infiltrates leading to resp failure or acute resp distress syndrome.

Precaution: Filgrastim should not be administered within 24 hours before and after chemotherapy. Premalignant or malignant myeloid condition; sickle-cell disease; osteoporotic bone disease; withdraw treatment if there are signs of pulmonary infiltrates. Fluid retention or heart failure. Monitor CBC and platelet count during therapy. Monitor bone density in patients with osteoporosis (long-term treatment). Regular morphological and cytogenic bone-marrow examinations in severe congenital neutropenia. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Filgrastim is a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor which binds to cell surface receptors on haemetopoietic cells thus stimulating the development of granulocytes to increase their migration and cytotoxicity.

Pharmasia Ltd.	Melasin Cream   15gm tube 110 BDT
	Indication: Melasma

Dose:  It should be applied at least 30 minutes before bedtime. A thin film of the cream should be applied to the hyperpigmented areas of melasma including about ½ inch of normal appearing skin surrounding each lesion.

Cream is for short-term (up to 8 weeks) treatment of moderate to severe melasma of the face. It is not for long-term (more than 8 weeks) or maintenance (continuous) treatment of melasma.


Contra-indication:  A history of hypersensitivity, allergy, or intolerance to this product or any of its components.

Side effects: The most frequently reported events were erythema, desquamation, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and skin atrophy at the site of application. The majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity.

Precaution: Cream contains hydroquinone and tretinoin that may cause mild to moderate irritation such as skin reddening, peeling, mild burning sensation, dryness, and pruritus. Transient skin reddening or mild burning sensation does not preclude treatment. If a reaction suggests hypersensitivity or chemical irritation, the use of the medication should be discontinued.
 Cream also contains the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Manifestations of Cushing’s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroid while on treatment. If HPA axis suppression is noted, Cream should be discontinued.

Mode of action: Fluocinolone acetonide is a synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid that is used topically for its anti-inflammatory, anti-pruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. Hydroquinone is used as a depigmenting agent. Tretinoin is a retinoid that is appears to stimulate mitosis, increases turnover of follicular epithelial cells and reduces their cohesiveness.

	Indication: Hypertension, Congestive heart failure, Oedema, Ascites

Dose: Adult: Per tab contains furosemide 20 mg and spironolactone 50 mg. 1-4 tabs/day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity, anuria or severe oliguria, hypovolaemia, hyponatraemia, hypotension, urinary retention due to prostatic hypertrophy, Addison's disease, renal impairment, hyperkalaemia, acute or severe liver failure. Pregnancy and lactation.

Side effects: Fluid and electrolyte imbalance, nausea, diarrhoea, blurred vision, headache, dizziness, hypotension, photosensitisation, hepatic dysfunction, hyperglycaemia and glycosuria, rarely bone marrow depression, gynaecomastia, hirsutism, hoarseness, menstrual irregularities, loss of libido, impotence.
Potentially Fatal: Severe hyperkalaemia in patients with preexisting renal impairment or taking ACE inhibitors, agranulocytosis, cardiac arrhythmias.

Precaution: Concomitant use with ACE inhibitors, monitor fluids and electrolytes including changes in serum K levels. Dilutional hyponatraemia or even a true low-salt syndrome may develop. General anaesthesia.

Mode of action: Furosemide inhibits reabsorption of Na+, Cl- and K+. Continuous use may also lead to secondary hyperaldosteronism. Spironolactone is a specific antagonist of aldosterone. It increases Na and water excretion but retains K+. Thus it acts both as diuretic and an antihypertensive. It reduces oedema and counteracts secondary aldosteronism caused by vol depletion Na loss. K loss is reduced.

Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: 1.frusemide ..--.Aminoglycosides and ethacrynic acid (increased ototoxicity), tubocurazine, succinylcholine (effects enhanced). Sucralfate reduces effects of furosemide. Should be given 2 hr apart. NSAIDs reduce natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of furosemide. Corticosteroids may antagonise action. Digoxin levels may be increased. Warfarin effects may be reduced.
Potentially Fatal: Potassium supplements or potassium-rich diet, ACE inhibitors, general anaesthetics (reduced vascular responsiveness to catecholamines), lithium toxicity. 2.spironolactone....Sodium excretion effect may be inhibited by aspirin. May reduce ulcer-healing properties of carbenoxolone. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity when used with NSAIDs or ciclosporin. Hyperkalaemia may occur if given with potassium supplements, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, NSAIDs, ciclosporin or trilostane. May increase risk of orthostatic hypotension when used with barbiturates, narcotics or alcohol. May reduce vascular responsiveness to pressor amines. May increase half-life of digoxin.
Potentially Fatal: Increased risk of lithium toxicity when used concurrently.Pfizer Puus SP.A,., Belgium	Fucidin-H Cream  1's pack 80 BDT

Precaution: Discontinuation or transfer from other antiepileptics, history of psychotic illness; renal impairment; pregnancy. Gradual withdrawal over at least 7 days to prevent an increase in seizure frequency.

Mode of action: Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA but is neither a GABA agonist nor antagonist. High affinity gabapentin binding sites are located throughout the brain. These sites correspond to the presence of voltage-gated Ca channels particularly controlling the ?-2/?-1 subunit. This channel appears to be located presynaptically and may modulate the release of excitatory neurotransmitters which participate in epileptogenesis and nociception.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: May increase plasma level w/ morphine. Reduced absorption w/ antacids.Popular	Gadoscan Injection 287 mg 200's pack 500 BDT

	Indication:  Indicated for intravenous use in MRI to visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity (or those thought to cause abnormalities in the blood-brain barrier) in the brain (intracranial lesions), spine, and associated tissues

Dose: Adults: The recommended dose  is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) administered as a bolus intravenous injection. Pediatric Patients (2-16 years): The recommended dose  is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) administered as a bolus intravenous injection.

Contra-indication: Chronic, severe kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate, GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m²), or
acute kidney injury
prior hypersensitivity reaction

Side effects:    1. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis  .
  2.  Hypersensitivity reactions .

Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Precaution: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities. 

The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m²) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. 

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. 

Mode of action: 

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:Indication:  Injection is indicated for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with abnormal blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity of the brain, spine and associated tissues.
 It also indicated for use with MRI to provide contrast enhancement and facilitate visualization of lesions with abnormal vascularity in the liver in patients who are highly suspect for liver structural abnormalities on computed tomography.

Concurrent use w/ drugs that inhibit replication of rapidly dividing cells (e.g. dapsone, pentamidine, pyrimethamine, flucytosine, cytotoxic antineoplastic agents, amphotericin B, co-trimoxazole, other nucleoside analogues) may result in additive toxicity.Indication: Ovarian stimulation, Assisted reproduction

Dose: Subcutaneous
Ovarian stimulation regimens for assisted reproduction in infertility
Adult: As acetate: 250 mcg once daily, starting on day 6 of ovarian stimulation and continued until ovulation induction.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, lactation, moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment.

Side effects: Nausea, headache, inj site reactions, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, abdominal pain, vag bleeding, dizziness, malaise, congenital abnormalities.

Precaution: Women with active allergic conditions or a history of allergies.

Mode of action: Ganirelix is a gonadorelin (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone) antagonist. It competitively blocks the gonadotropin-release hormone receptors on the pituitary gonadotroph and transduction pathway. This suppresses gonadotropin secretion and luteinising hormone secretion thus preventing ovulation until the follicles are of adequate size.

Precaution: Concurrent use of neuromuscular blocking agents; myasthenia gravis, parkinsonism; conditions predisposing to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity; lactation. Monitor plasma concentrations of gentamicin in patients receiving high doses or prolonged courses, in infants, elderly, patients with renal impairment, cystic fibrosis or significant obesity. Monitor auditory and renal functions.

Mode of action: Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside that binds to 30s and 50s ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria disrupting protein synthesis, thus rendering the bacterial cell membrane defective.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Synergistic with ampicillin, benzylpenicillin and other ?-lactam antibiotics. Increased risk of severe respiratory depression when used concurrently with anaesthetics or opioids. May reduce renal clearance of zalcitabine and induce hypocalcaemia when used with biphosphonates. Not to be used with agalsidase alfa or beta as it may inhibit ?-galactosidase activity.
Potentially Fatal: Increased incidence of ototoxicity when combined with ethacrynic acid and furosemide. Cephalosporins, ciclosporin, cisplatin, vancomycin, hydrocortisone and indometacin potentiate nephrotoxicity.

Adult: Each tab contains pioglitazone 15 mg or 30 mg and glimepiride 2 mg or 4 mg: Initially, 1 tab once daily then titrate gradually as needed.

For patients inadequately controlled on glimepiride monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg or 30 mg/4 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,

For patients inadequately controlled on pioglitazone monotherapy: 30 mg/2 mg once daily and gradually titrated, as needed, after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response and tolerability,

Contra-indication:     Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure 

    Use in patients with known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone, glimepiride or any other component. 

    Use in patients with known history of an allergic reaction to sulfonamide derivatives. 

Side effects:     Congestive Heart Failure 
    Hypoglycemia 

    Edema 

    Fractures

    Hemolytic Anemia 

Precaution: Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when  is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of  must be considered 

Mode of action: Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, reduces blood glucose by improving target cell response to insulin w/o increasing pancreatic insulin secretion and is dependent on the presence of insulin for activity. Glimepiride, a sulfonylurea, stimulates insulin release from the pancreatic beta-cells. It also reduces glucose output from the liver and increases insulin sensitivity at peripheral target sites.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased plasma levels w/ CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) and CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole). Decreased plasma levels w/ CYP2C8 inducers (e.g. rifampicin). Colesevelam may reduce the max plasma concentration and total exposure of glimepiride. Concominant use w/ oral miconazole may lead to severe hypoglycaemia.ACI	Roglim 1 TAB dr   30's pack 301.20 BDT

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: The usual starting dose of 1mg/4 mg or 2 mg/4 mg once daily.
The maximum recommended daily dose of is 4 mg of Glimepiride and 8 mg of Rosiglitazone.
The dosage of anti-diabetic therapy should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability. 


Contra-indication: Patients with established Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated.

Side effects: Hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, nausea, allergic skin reactions, e.g., pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions.

Rosiglitazone:The mostcommon adverse experiences with Rosiglitazone are upper
respiratory tract infection, injury, and headache. Events of anemia and edema tended to be reported more frequently at higher doses, angioedema and urticaria have been reported rarely.


Precaution: Hypoglycemia: All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia. Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Debilitated or malnourished patients and those with adrenal, pituitary
, renal, or hepatic insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose lowering drugs.
Loss of Control of Blood Glucose:
When a patient stabilized on any antidiabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a temporary loss of glycemic control may occur.

Edema:
Combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients with edema.
Since thiazolidinediones, including Rosiglitazone can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, Combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients at risk for heart failure.
Weight Gain:
Dose-related weight gain was seen with Rosiglitazone alone and in combination with other hypoglycemic agents. 
Hepatic Effects:
Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with combination of Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone in all patients and periodically thereafter per the clinical
judgment of the healthcare professional. 

Mode of action:  Glimepiride: Initial effect to increase insulin secretion from beta cells; may also decrease rate of hepatic glucose production and increase insulin receptor sensitivity.

Rosiglitazone: Lowers glucose by improving target cell response to insulin without increasing pancreatic cell secretion; activates nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which influences the production of gene products involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Glimepiride: Salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, coumarin anticoagulants, probenecid, CYP2C9 inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, disopyramide, fluoxetine, quinolones, ACE inhibitors, MAOIs and ?-blockers may potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of glimepiride.

Mode of action: Chorionic Gonadotrophin is a polypeptide hormone produced by the human placenta. It stimulates the production of gonadal steroid hormones by inducing interstitial cells (Leydig cells) of the testis to produce androgens and the corpus luteum of the ovary to produce progesterone.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Interactions of Human chorionic gonadotrophin  with other medicines have not been investigated; interactions with commonly used medicinal products cannot be excluded.
Following administration, Human chorionic gonadotrophin  may interfere for up to 10 days with the immunological determination of serum/urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), leading to a false positive pregnancy test.

Incompatibilities: In the absence of compatibility studies, Pregnyl must not be mixed with other medicinal products.Nipa	Polymycin Eye Drops   5  ml drop 30.35 BDT
	
Opso Saline Ltd.	Polymix G Eye Drops   5  ml drop 30.11 BDT
	Indication: Conjunctivitis, Keratitis, Blepharitis, Superficial bacterial infections, Corneal ulcer, Keratoconjunctivitis

Dose: Instill one or two drops into the affected eye every 4 hours for 7 to 10 days. In severe infections, dosage may be increased to as much as two drops every hour.

Contra-indication: This product is contraindicated in those persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components.

Side effects: Adverse reactions have occurred with the anti-infective components of this product. The exact incidence is not known. Reactions occurring most often are allergic reactions including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . More serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely.

Local irritation on instillation has also been reported.

Precaution: As with other antibiotic preparations, prolonged use of this product may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate measures should be initiated.

Bacterial resistance to this product may also develop. If purulent discharge, inflammation or pain becomes aggravated, the patient should discontinue use of the medication and consult a physician.

There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of topical ophthalmic products in multiple-dose containers which have been inadvertently contaminated by patients, most of whom had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface .

Allergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.

Mode of action: Gramicidin is an antibacterial which is too toxic to be used systemically, so it is rather used as a topical and ophth agent and in combination with other antibacterials (neomycin and polymixin B) and also with corticosteroids.

Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It binds to 30S ribosomal subunits of bacterial ribosome thus inhibiting protein synthesis and generating errors in genetic code transcription causing cell death. It acts against many gram-negative aerobes and some gram-positive aerobes. It lacks activity against fungi, viruses and most anaerobic bacteria.

Polymyxin B disrupts the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane of mostly gm-ve organisms allowing leakage of intracellular constituents by binding to membrane phospholipids.

Mode of action: Triamcinolone is a fluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and anti-allergic actions. Nystatin, a polyene antifungal antibiotic, binds to ergosterol and interferes with the permeability of cell membrane of susceptible fungi e.g Candida spp. Neomycin is an aminoglycoside, often used topically in the infections against susceptible staphylococci and other organisms. Gramicidin, an antibacterial substance extracted from tyrothricin, is active against many Gram-positive bacteria. Used together, this combination provides a wide coverage against gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria and yeast which are responsible for most of the skin infections.

Children 2-5 years: 2.5 ml (1/2 teaspoonful) three times a day.


Contra-indication: Patients with a known hypersensitivity to guaiphenesin, psedoephedrine or triprolidine. Contraindicated in persons under treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 2 weeks of stopping such treatment.
Patients with severe hypertension or severe coronary artery disease

Side effects: Central nervous system (CNS) depression or excitation may occur. Sleep disturbance and rarely hallucination have been reported. Skin rashes, tachycardia, dryness of mouth, nose and throat have occasionally been reported. Urinary retention has been reported occasionally in men receiving pseudoephedrine; prostatic enlargement could have been an important predisposing factor.

Precaution:  It may cause drowsiness and impair performance in tests of auditory vigilance. It may also impair the patients ability to drive and also to use machineries. So, driving and operation of machineries should be avoided during treatment with Aquaphen. Although there are no objective data, Avoid the concomitant use of alcohol or other centrally acting sedatives.
Although Pseudoephedrine has virtually no pressor effect in patients with normal blood pressure, Aquaphen should be used with caution in patients taking antihypertensive agents, tricyclic antidepressants or other sympathomimetic agents such as decongestant, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants.  It effects   on the blood pressure of these patients should be observed before recommending repeated or unsupervised treatment.
As with other sympathomimetic agents, caution should be exercised in patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, elevated intraocular pressure and prostatic enlargement.  It should not be used for persistent or chronic cough such as occurs with smoking, asthma or emphysema or where cough is accompanied by excessive secretions unless directed by a physician.

Mode of action: Triprolidine hydrochloride is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist with antimuscarinic and mild sedative properties.

Pseudoephedrine is both an ?-and ?-adrenergic receptor agonist. It causes vasoconstriction via direct stimulation of ?-adrenergic receptors of the respiratory mucosa. It also directly stimulates ?-adrenergic receptors causing bronchial relaxation, increased heart rate and contractility.

Guaifenesin increases the volume and reduce the viscosity of tenacious sputum and is used as an expectorant for productive cough.

Finger pressure should be applied on the lachrymal sac for 1-2 minutes after instillation to reduce systemic absorption.

Mode of action: Homatropine, a tertiary amine antimuscarinic, produces dilation and loss of accommodation by blocking the response of iris sphincter muscle and the accommodative ciliary muscle to cholinergic stimulation.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Effects may be increased by drugs with antimuscarinic effect such as; some antihistamines; phenothiazines; antipsychotics; TCAs; MAOIs or parasympathomimetics.Indication: Postexposure prophylaxis of Rabies

Dose: Recommended Dose: Adults and Children: 40 IU/kg of body weight. However, for children, particularly in the case of multiple wounds, it has been proposed to dilute the dose 2-3 times in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution to obtain a sufficient quantity of equine rabies immune globulin to infiltrate the wound(s) correctly.

It must be injected slowly by the IM route.
If anatomically feasible, as much as possible of the dose should be infiltrated around and into the wounds. The remainder of the dose should be administered IM (into the gluteal region) in a single injection.

As a general rule, 1 IU of Factor IX activity per kg can be expected to increase the circulating level of Factor IX by 1% [IU/dL] of normal.

Contra-indication: Known history of allergic symptoms to horse proteins.

Side effects: Do not administer the vaccine IV due to the risk of shock ie, sudden collapse with drop in blood pressure. 

Precaution: Administered intravenously at a rate that will permit observation of the patient for any immediate reaction. Rates of infusion of up to 225 IU per minute have been regularly tolerated with no adverse reactions. If any reaction takes place that is thought to be related to the administration   , the rate of infusion should be decreased or the infusion stopped, as dictated by the response of the patient. The infusion should be stopped promptly and appropriate countermeasures and supportive therapy should be administered should evidence of an acute hypersensitivity reaction be observed. Patients known to have major deletion mutations of the factor IX gene may be at increased risk for inhibitor formation and acute hypersensitivity reactions.

Mode of action: Rabies immunoglobulins provide passive immunity to rabies. 2 types of immunoglobulin are available namely, human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) and purified equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG). HRIG is prepared from the plasma of human donors hyperimmunised with rabies vaccine and is preferred over ERIG.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Decreased response to live virus vaccine (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella and varicella), admin at least 4 mth after human rabies immunoglobulin admin.Unimed & Unihealth Manufacturers Ltd.	Biotest Human Albumin Solution For Infusion 20% 1's pack(50ml) 2802 BDT

Child: Not recommended for use in girls below 10 yr of age.

Contra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to any component. 

Side effects: The most common reaction observed after vaccine administration was injection site pain, which occurred after 78% of all doses. The majority of these reactions were of mild to moderate severity and were not long lasting.
Adverse reactions considered as being at least possibly related to vaccination have been categorized by frequency.

Infections and Infestations: Uncommon: Upper respiratory tract infection.
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Uncommon: Lymphadenopathy.
Nervous System Disorders: Very Common: Headache. Uncommon: Dizziness.
Gastrointestinal Disorders: Common: Gastrointestinal disturbances including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Common: Itching/pruritus, rash, urticaria.
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders: Very Common: Myalgia. Common: Arthralgia.
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Very Common: Injection site reactions including pain, redness, swelling, fatigue. Common: Fever (?38°C). Uncommon: Other injection site reactions eg, induration, local paresthesia.
 Immune System Disorders: Rare: Allergic reactions (including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions), angioedema.
Nervous System Disorders: Rare: Syncope or vasovagal responses to injection, sometimes accompanied by tonic-clonic movements.

Precaution: Do not administer this product intravenously, intradermally, or subcutaneously.
As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of Cervarix.
As with other vaccines, the administration of Cervarix should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness. However, the presence of a minor infection eg, a cold should not result in the deferral of vaccination.
Use in lactation: The effect on breastfed infants of the administration of Cervarix to their mothers has not been evaluated in clinical studies.
Cervarix should only be used during breastfeeding when the possible advantages outweigh the possible risks.
Serological data suggest a transfer of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies via the milk during the lactation period in rats. However, it is unknown whether vaccine-induced antibodies are excreted in human breast milk.

Mode of action: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 and 18 cause about 70% of cervical cancer. HPV bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine is a non-infectious vaccine produced by recombinant technology, which contains virus-like particles (VLP) of the major capsid L1 protein of oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18. Efficacy of vaccine may be mediated by the production of IgG neutralizing antibodies against the HPV-L1 capsid proteins.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Immunosuppressive therapies e.g. irradiation, cytotoxic drugs and corticorsteroids may reduce a patient's immune response to the vaccine.GlaxoSmithkline Biologicals S.A,Belgium	Rotarix Oral Vaccine  1.5 ml  1 ml vial with oral applicator 1548.50 BDT
	Indication: Prevention of Rotavirus diarrhea

Dose: The vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose should be given between 6 and 14 weeks of age. The interval between the two doses should not be less than 4 weeks. The vaccine course should be completed by the age of 24 weeks as safety has not been assessed in older children. In clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such circumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same vaccination visit.

Contra-indication: Subjects with history of intussusception. Subjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a contraindication for immunisation.

Side effects: Risk of intussusception has not been established. The overall incidence of intussusception remains rare.

Precaution: It is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. Parents/guardians should be advised to seek medical advice promptly where these signs/symptoms are evident. There is a potential risk for transmission to non-vaccinated contacts. It should be administered with caution to infants with close contacts who are immunodeficient, such as household members with malignancies or who are otherwise immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Contacts of recent vaccinees should be advised to observe personal hygiene (e.g. washing their hands when changing childrenâ€™s nappies).

Mode of action: Rotavirus is one of the important causes of severe acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children. There are 2 commercially available forms of rotavirus vaccine. Rotarix®: A live, attenuated monovalent vaccine derived from human strain indicated for prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G1, G3, G4 and G9 serotypes; RotaTeq® as a live, pentavalent human-bovine reassortant vaccine indicated for prevention of gastreoenteritis caused by rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3 and G4. Although presence of porcine cirovirus (PCV1 and PCV2) DNA have been detected in the rotavirus vaccine, current available information shows that there is no evidence that PCV1 or PCV2 poses a safety risk to humans. Exact immunologic mechanism of action is not fully understood although it is known that vaccine viruses replicate in the small intestine and promote active immunity.

Potentially Fatal: Acute renal failure.

Precaution: Drugs that act on renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal injury and death when used in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Olmesartan medoxomil should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. May be associated with oliguria, progressive azotaemia, and acute renal failure (rare). Patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis may have increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. Caution in renal impairment; monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels periodically. Avoid use in severe renal impairment (CrCl< 20 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment. Caution in patients with aortic or mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with primary aldosteronism may not respond to angiotensin receptor antagonist.

Dose: Adult: PO Per tab contains ramipril 2.5 mg and hydrochlorthiazide 12.5 mg: 1 tab/day. Max: 4 tab/day.

Contra-indication: Anuria, hypersensitivity, history of angioedema, bilateral renal artery stenosis, unilateral renal artery stenosis

Side effects: Pancreatitis, jaundice, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, cramps, constipation, gastric irritation, anorexia, aplastic anaemia, agranulocytosis, leukopaenia, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, vasculitis, resp distress, including pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema, photosensitivity, fever, urticaria, rash, hyperglycaemia, glycosuria, hyperuricaemia, muscle spasm, vertigo, paraesthesias, dizziness, headache, restlessness, renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis, erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis including toxic epidermal necrolysis, alopoecia, transient blurred vision, xanthopsia, impotence, dizziness, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, cough, rarely symptomatic hypotension, angioneurotic oedema of face, lips, tongue, glottis and larynx, syncope, renal impairment, hypersensitivity reactions.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions, electrolyte imbalance, hypotension.

Precaution: Severe renal disease, impaired hepatic, allergy or bronchial asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, acute gout, diabetes mellitus, elderly, collagen vascular diseases, should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Ramipril is a long-acting ACE inhibitor which is metabolised into the active metabolite ramiprilat. Supine and standing blood pressures (BP) are reduced witho reflex tachycardia. Ventricular hypertrophy is reversed and renal blood flow increased. In CHF (CHF), pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are reduced. Cardiac function is improved. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. It increases excretion of Na and chloride in approx equiv amounts. Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of K and bicarbonate. The rationale behind this combination is that these have a synergistic effect in lowering BP and offer an advantage of once-daily dosing convenience.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Hydrochlorthiazide in combination with alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics potentiates orthostatic hypotension. When coadministered with other antihypertensive gives additive effect. Absorption is reduced with cholestyramine and colestipol resins. Hypokalemia is observed with corticosteroids, tubocurarine responsiveness to the muscle relaxant is increased. It decreases the renal clearance of lithium and increases the risk of lithium toxicity. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents can reduce the diuretic and natriuretic effect of hydrochlorthiazide. 

Ramipril with potassium-sparing diuretics results in severe hyperkaelemia. May increase serum lithium concentration, NSAIDs may reduce the effect of the drug and cause deterioration of renal function.Novartis (Bangladesh) Ltd.	Mitosan 80 PLUS 80/12.5 TAB dr   20's pack 420 BDT

Square	Pracort Ointment    60 BDT
	Indication: Hemorrhoids, Insect bites, Skin irritations, Corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, Anal itching

Dose: Topical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin film three to four times daily depending on the severity of the condition. Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.

Contra-indication: Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation.

Side effects:  If the drug is absorbed in the system patient may feel blurred vision, halos around lights, irregular heart rate, insomnia. Redness, burning, itching and irritation may occur in application site.

Precaution: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.

Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area and under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.

Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity.  

If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.

In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

Mode of action: Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Its anti-inflammatory action is due to the suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It may also be used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical insufficiency.

Local anesthetic; stabilizes neuronal membranes and prevent generation/conduction of nerve impulses by reducing sodium permeability and increasing action potential threshold.

	Indication: Chloasma, Melasma, Freckles, Senile lentigines, Hyperpigmentation

Dose: Hydroquinone should be applied to the affected area and rubbed in well twice daily or as directed by a physician. Most discolorations begin to lighten after 4 weeks of treatment but it may take longer. After desired bleaching, use only as needed to maintain results of treatment. Hydroquinone bleaching is faster, more dependable and easier if the treated area is protected from ultraviolet light. Therefore, exposure to sunlight should be minimized at the period of treatment. During day, an effective broad-spectrum sunscreen should be used, unnecessary solar exposure should be avoided and protective clothing should be used to prevent repigmentation of treated areas. After reduction of hyperpigmentation, use of sunscreen agents and/or protective clothing should continue.Use in children: Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.

Contra-indication: Hydroquinone is contraindicated to patients with prior history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to hydroquinone or other ingredients in the preparation.

Side effects: No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur in which case the medication should be discontinued.

Precaution: Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin to check in 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, further treatment is not advised. If no bleaching or lightening effect is noted after 2 months of treatment, the medication should be discontinued.Contact with the eyes and lips should be avoided. Hydroquinone should not be applied to cut or abraded skin.

Mode of action: Hydroquinone is a topical depigmentating agent used in hyperpigmentation conditions by suppressing melanocyte metabolic processes. It also increases melanin excretion from melanocytes and prevents its production.

	Indication: Vitamin B12 deficiency, Cyanide poisoning

Dose: Thirty mcg daily for 5 to 10 days followed by 100 to 200 mcg monthly injected intramuscularly. If the patient is critically ill, or has neurologic disease, an infectious disease or hyperthyroidism, considerably higher doses may be indicated. However, current data indicate that the optimum obtainable neurologic response may be expected with a dosage of vitamin B12 sufficient to produce good hematologic response. Children may be given a total of 1 to 5 mg over a period of 2 or more weeks in doses of 100 mcg, then 30 to 50 mcg every 4 weeks for maintenance.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.

Side effects: Mild transient diarrhea, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of entire body, and anaphylaxis.

A few patients may experience pain after injection of hydroxocobalamin.

Precaution: General

The validity of diagnostic vitamin B12 or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy.

Vitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid and since it might improve folic acid deficient megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12 could mask the true diagnosis.

Hypokalemia and thrombocytosis could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with B12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.

Mode of action: Vitamin B12 with hydroxyl group complexed to cobalt which can be displaced by cyanide resulting in cyanocobalamin that is renally excreted

	Indication: Depression,Nocturnal enuresis

Dose: Depression, initially up to 75 mg daily in divided doses increased gradually to 150-200 mg (up to 300 mg in hospital patients); up to 150 mg may be given as a single dose at bedtime; elderly initially 10 mg daily, increased gradually to 30-50 mg daily; child not recommended for depression.
Nocturnal enuresis, child 7-8 years 25 mg, 8-11 years 25-50 mg, over 11 years 50-75 mg at bedtime; max. period of treatment (including gradual withdrawal) 3 months-full physical examination before further course.

Contra-indication: Imipramine should not be given in conjunction with, or within 14 days of treatment with a MAO inhibitor. Combined therapy of this type could lead to the appearance of serious interactions such as hypertensive crises, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, spasticity, severe convulsions or coma and death may occur. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients with existing severe hepatic or renal damage, and those with a history of blood dyscrasias. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants belonging to the dibenzazepine group. Imipramine is contraindicated for use during the acute recovery phase following a myocardial infarction. It should not be used in patients with convulsive disorders or glaucoma. 

Side effects: The most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Imipramine usage has been linked to both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported. Confusion, disorientation, delusions, insomnia, and anxiety have also been reported as side effects in a small percentage of people taking imipramine. Problems associated with the skin (loss of sensation, numbness and tingling, rashes, spots, itching and puffiness), seizures, and ringing in the ears have also been reported. Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping are all side effects associated with imipramine usage in a small number of people.

Precaution: Imipramine should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when imipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines. Imipramine may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic dosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is increased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of pre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.

Mode of action: Imipramine inhibits noradrenaline re-uptake and, to a lesser extent, that of serotonin.

Novartis (Bangladesh) Ltd.	Onbrez Breezhaler 300mg CAP 300mg 30's pack 3811 BDT
	Indication: Asthma, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Dose: The recommended dosage  is the once-daily inhalation of the contents of one 75 mcg   capsule using the  inhaler. 

Contra-indication: Patients with asthma without use of a long-term asthma control medication
Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to indacaterol or to any of the ingredients.

Side effects:   1     Clinical Trials Experience in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
 2     Clinical Trials Experience in Asthma
 3     Postmarketing Experience 

Precaution:  Data from a large placebo-controlled study in asthma patients showed that long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death. Data are not available to determine whether the rate of death in patients with COPD is increased by long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists.
A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of the long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists, including  . No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in patients treated     has been conducted. The safety and efficacy  patients with asthma have not been established. It is not indicated for the treatment of asthma. 
Serious asthma-related events, including death   . The sizes of these studies were not adequate to precisely quantify the differences in serious asthma exacerbation rates between treatment groups.

Mode of action: Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist; when inhaled, acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator

Stimulates intracellular adenyl cyclase, causing conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP; increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle

In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors (selectivity profile is similar to formoterol)

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Potentiated adverse effects w/ other sympathomimetic agents; possible hypokalaemic effect w/ methylxanthine derivatives, steroids or non-K-sparing diuretics. Other long-acting ?2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing long-acting ?2-adrenergic agonists. Inhibition of the key contributors of indacaterol clearance, CYP3A4 and P-gp.Novartis (Bangladesh) Ltd.	Ultibro Breezhaler Dry powder inhalation capsule 110/50 mcg   BDT
	Indication: Bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Dose: (Indacaterol maleate and glycopyrronium bromide) is a combination of a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).
Recommeded Dose: One capsule once daily.
Indacaterol + Glycopyrronium Breezhaler is recommended to be administered at the same time of the day each day. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day. Patients should be instructed not to take >1 dose in a day.
Special Populations: Renal Impairment: This Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis it should be used only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk. 
Hepatic Impairment: This Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data available for the use of Indacaterol + Glycopyrronium Breezhaler in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore caution should be observed in these patients.
Elderly: Indacaterol + Glycopyrronium Breezhaler can be used at the recommended dose in elderly patients (?75 years).
Administration: For inhalation use only. The capsules must not be swallowed.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to indacaterol, glycopyrronium or to any of the excipients of  Indacaterol + Glycopyrronium Breezhaler.
Use in children: This should not be used in patients <18 years.

Side effects: Upper resp tract infection; nasopharyngitis, UTI, sinusitis, rhinitis; dizziness, headache, cough, oropharyngeal pain including throat irritation, dyspepsia, dental carries, gastroenteritis, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia & chest pain.

Precaution: Concomitant use w/ long-acting ?-agonists or long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Not for the treatment of asthma. Immediately discontinue use if hypersensitivity & paradoxical bronchospasm occurs. Narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, CV disorders (CAD, acute MI, cardiac arrhythmia, HTN), convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, severe renal impairment; hypokalaemia; hyperglycaemia. Pregnancy & lactation.

Mode of action: When indacaterol and glycopyrronium are administered together in this Breezhaler, they provide additive efficacy due to their different mode of action targeting different receptors and pathways to achieve small muscle relaxation. Due to the differential density of ?2-adrenoceptors and M3-receptors in central versus smaller airways, ?2-agonists should be more effective in relaxing small airways while an anticholinergic compound may be more effective in large airways. Thus, for optimal bronchodilation in all regions of the human lung, a combination of a ?2-adrenergic agonist and a muscarinic antagonist may be beneficial.
Indacaterol: Indacaterol is an 'ultra' long-acting ?2-adrenergic agonist for once-daily administration. The pharmacological effects of ?2-adrenoceptor agonists, including indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP, cyclic monophosphate). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has >24-fold greater agonist activity at ?2-receptors compared to ?1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to ?3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol.
When inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. Indacaterol is a nearly full agonist at the human ?2-adrenergic receptor with nanomolar potency. In isolated human bronchus, indacaterol has a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action.
Glycopyrronium: Glycopyrronium is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) for once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Parasympathetic nerves are the major bronchoconstrictive neural pathway in airways and cholinergic tone is the key reversible component of airflow obstruction in COPD. Glycopyrronium works by blocking the bronchoconstrictor action of acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle cells, thereby dilating the airways.


Pregnancy category: A

Interaction: Decreases levodopa effects. Effects may be enhanced by using drugs with antimuscarinic properties or MAOIs concurrently. May antagonise the GI effects of cisapride, metoclopramide and dompeidone.

Pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders
Adult: As supp: 100 mg to be inserted at night and repeated in the morning if necessary.


Contra-indication: Indomethacin is contraindicated in patients with ulcer, gastritis, active ulcerative colitis, and should be used with caution in patients with a history of these disorders. It is also contraindicated in previously hypersensitive patient.

Side effects: Headaches, usually in the morning and mild vertigo may occur during the early weeks of therapy. These symptoms are transient and usually disappear with continued use or by reduction of the dose. Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric and abdominal pain are often due to large doses of the drug and disappear when the dose is reduced.

Precaution: Patient w/ known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease, fluid retention, history of GI disease (e.g. bleeding or ulcers), history of mental depression or other psychiatric disorder, epilepsy, or parkinsonian syndrome; existing infection that is adequately controlled. May mask signs and symptoms of infection. Hepatic and renal impairment. Elderly, childn. Pregnancy and lactation. 

Mode of action: Indometacin, an indole acetic acid derivative has anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions. It reversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and -2) enzymes, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: May increase plasma levels of methotrexate. Increased risk of GI bleeding w/ warfarin. May reduce hypotensive effects of hydralazine, furosemide, ?-blockers (e.g. atenolol, propranolol, oxprenolol), or thiazide diuretics. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ K-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, K supplements. May increase nephrotoxic effects of ciclosporin or triamterene. Increase plasma concentration w/ probenecid. May increase plasma levels of aminoglycoside (e.g. amikacin, gentamicin) in premature neonates. May enhance antipsychotic effect (e.g. severe drowsiness and confusion) of haloperidol. Al- or Mg-containing antacids may reduce GI disorders of indometacin.
Potentially Fatal: Diflunisal decreases renal clearance and increases plasma concentrations of indometacin which leads to fatal GI haemorrhage.Incepta	Influvax Injection 15 mcg / 0.5 ml   BDT

Dose: Recommended dosage for lipid-lowering and improving conditions related to peripheral vascular insufficiency ranges from 1500 mg to 4 grams daily, in divided dosages of two to three times daily.

Contra-indication: Contraindicated to children, early stage of stroke & people who have recently had a heart attack. It should not be used if anyone is allergic to one or any of its ingredients

Side effects: The most common side effects are headache, rash, paraesthesia, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, flushing, excessive fluid retention in the body tissues, postural hypotension, fainting

Precaution: Cautions should be exercised in patients with angina not well controlled by medical treatment and decreased blood supply through the vessels of the brain (cerebrovascular insufficiency).

Mode of action: It is the hexanicotinic acid ester of meso-inositol, also called inositol hexaniacinate (IHN) or inositol hexanicotinate or inositol nicotinate. Inositol Niacinate is a vasodilator and lipid-lowering agent. It improves circulation by releasing histamine, which causes the blood vessels to dilate and breaks up a protein needed for the clotting of blood. It also prevents the formation of lipids in the body, which helps to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

	Indication: Diabetes mellitus

Dose: Adult:  SC DM Dosage should be individualised and adjusted based on patient's glycaemic response. Usual range: 0.5-1 u/kg/day.

Contra-indication: Hypoglycaemia. Hypersensitivity to any of the components. 

Side effects: Adverse events commonly associated with human insulin therapy include the following:  Allergic reactions.  Injection site reaction, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, lipoatrophy, hypokalaemia, blurred vision. Hypoglycaemia, insulin resistance

Precaution: Pregnancy (insulin requirements tend to fall during the 1st trimester, increase during the 2nd and 3rd) and lactation. During infection.

Mode of action: Insulin lowers blood glucose levels. It regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism by inhibiting hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, and enhancing peripheral glucose disposal. The various insulin formulations are classified according to their durations of action after SC Inj. They are divided into short-, intermediate-, or long-acting insulin. Soluble insulin (also known as 'neutral insulin' or 'regular insulin') is a short-acting preparation. 

To extend the duration of action of insulin, preparations are formulated as suspensions in 2 methods. The 1st method involves complexing insulin with a protein so that it is slowly released, e.g. protamine zinc insulin (contains an excess of protamine) and isophane insulin (or NPH insulin which contains equal amounts of protamine and insulin). An alternative method is particle size modification e.g. insulin zinc suspensions. While all the formulations can be admin by SC inj, most by IM inj, only soluble insulin can be admin by IV. Compared to SC inj, IM admin usually has a faster onset of action, with a shorter duration of action.

	Indication: Diabetes Mellitus

Dose: Adult: S/C: Insulin Degludec is ultra long-acting basal insulin for once-daily at any time of the day, preferably at the same time every day.
Initiation:
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus:
The recommended daily starting dose is 10 units followed by individual dosage adjustments.

Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus:
Insulin Degludec is to be used once-daily with meal-time insulin and requires subsequent individual dosage adjustments.


In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Insulin Degludec can be administered alone or in any combination with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, GLP-1 receptor agonists and bolus insulin.

In type 1 diabetes mellitus, Insulin Degludec must be combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin to cover mealtime insulin requirements.

On occasions when administration at the same time of the day is not possible, Insulin Degludec allows for flexibility in the timing of insulin administration. A minimum of 8 hours between injections should always be ensured.

Patients who forget a dose, are advised to take it upon discovery and then resume their usual once-daily dosing schedule.

Special populations:

Elderly patients (> 65 years old):

Insulin Degludec can be used in elderly patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.

Renal and hepatic impairment:

Degludec can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.

Paediatric population:

The safety and efficacy of Insulin Degludec in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been established.




Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.Hypoglycaemia, Hyperglycaemia, Eye disorder.

Side effects: Hypoglycemia, Lipodystrophy & Reactions at the site of injection may occur. 
Rarer side effects include: Hypersensitivity, Urticaria, Peripheral oedema


Precaution: Insulin Degludecs must not be injected into a vein (intravenously) or a muscle (intramuscularly) and must not be used in infusion pumps.

There is no experience with Insulin Degludec in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

Immune system disorders
With insulin preparations, allergic reactions may occur. Immediate-type allergic reactions to either insulin itself or the excipients may potentially be life-threatening.
With Ryzodeg, hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhoea, nausea, tiredness and itching) and urticaria were reported rarely.

Lipodystrophy
Lipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the particular injection area may help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions.
Injection site reactions
Injection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) occurred in patients treated with
Ryzodeg. These reactions are usually mild and transitory and they normally disappear during continued treatment.



Precaution: Hypoglycaemia
Omission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Concomitant illness, especially infections and fever, usually increases the patient's insulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose.


Hyperglycaemia
Administration of rapid-acting insulin is recommended in situations with severe hyperglycaemia. Inadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of treatment in patients requiring insulin may lead to hyperglycaemia and potentially to diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially infections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased insulin requirement.

Eye disorder
Intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.

Avoidance of accidental mix-ups
Patients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between Ryzodeg and other insulin products.

Older patients (? 65 years old)
Ryzodeg can be used in older patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.

Paediatric population
Ryzodeg has been administered to children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for the investigation of pharmacokinetic properties. Safety and efficacy have not been investigated in children and adolescents.




Mode of action: Insulin degludec and insulin aspart binds specifically to the human insulin receptor and results in the same pharmacological effects as human insulin.

The blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following the binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver.

Mode of action: Iopamidol is a nonionic iodinated radiographic contrast medium. It allows visualisation of internal body structures by opacifying the path of its flow.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Arrhythmias, arterial spasm, flushing, vasodilatation, angina, cardiopulmonary arrest; dizziness, confusion, paraesthesia, visual disturbances, seizure, paralysis, coma, temporary amnesia; inj site pain, pallor, periorbital and facial oedema; coughing, sneezing, rhinitis, asthma, apnoea, laryngeal oedema, chest tightness; watery itchy eyes, lachrymation, conjunctivitis; muscle spasm, involuntary leg movement; tremors, malaise; severe retching and choking, abdominal pain; urogenital pain, haematuria.
Potentially Fatal: Severe anaphylactoid reactions.Indication: Iopanoic Acid is primarily indicated in conditions like Epilepsy (monotherapy), Radiological contrast agent, Vestibular disorders. 

Dose:  Adult Dosage  42.857 mg/kg 	  43 (42.857) As recommended. 	  PO 	  Once,as required

Contra-indication: Iopanoic Acid is contraindicated in conditions like Cardiovascular disease, Malabsorption. 

Side effects:  Dizziness, Headache, Diarrhea, Rashes, Urticaria, Pruritus, Dysuria, Cramps, Nausea and vomiting, Heart burn, Sore throat.

Precaution: Avoid use of iopanoic acid in patients with severe renal (kidney) or hepatic (liver) disease. Dose higher than 3gm should not be given to patients with renal impairment. Avoid use in presence of acute gastro-intestinal disease, as it may impair the absorption. It should be used with caution in patients with history of hypersensitivity to iodine, or other contrast media, hyperthyroidism, hyperuricaemia

Mode of action: 

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction:Indication: Peripheral and coronary arteriography and left ventriculography,Intravenous excretory urography,Angiography

Dose: As with all radiopaque contrast agents, only the lowest dose necessary to obtain adequate visualization should be used. A lower dose may reduce the possibility of an adverse reaction. Most procedures do not require use of either the maximum volume or the highest concentration . The combination of volume and concentration  to be used should be carefully individualized accounting for factors such as age, body weight, size of the vessel and the rate of blood flow within the vessel. Other factors such as anticipated pathology, degree and extent of opacification required, structure(s) or area to be examined, disease processes affecting the patient, and equipment and technique to be employed should be considered.

It is desirable that intravascularly administered iodinated contrast agents be at or close to body temperature when injected.

If during administration a reaction occurs, the injection should be stopped until the reaction has subsided.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Usually mild to moderate, of short duration and resolve spontaneously (without treatment). However, serious, life-threatening and fatal reactions, mostly of cardiovascular origin, have been associated with the administration of iodine-containing contrast media.

Injections of contrast media are often associated with sensations of warmth and pain. In controlled double-blind clinical studies, significantly less warmth and pain were associated with the injection   than with iothalamate meglumine, diatrizoate meglumine, and diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium.

Precaution: Diagnostic procedures which involve the use of iodinated intravascular contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel skilled and experienced in the particular procedure to be performed. A fully equipped emergency cart, or equivalent supplies and equipment, and personnel competent in recognizing and treating adverse reactions of all types should always be available. Since severe delayed reactions have been known to occur, emergency facilities and competent personnel should be available for at least 30 to 60 minutes after administration.

Contra-indication: The combination of Salbutamol & Ipratropium Bromide is contraindicated in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and tachyarrhythmia and in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to atropine or its derivatives, or to any other component of the product.

Side effects: Adverse Effects: In common with other beta-agonists containing products, side effects of Windel Plus can include fine tremor of skeletal muscles and nervousness and less frequently, tachycardia, dizziness, palpitations or headache, especially in hypersensitive patients.
Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from prolonged and / or high dose beta2-agonist therapy.
As with use of other inhalation therapy, cough, local irritation and, less commonly, inhalation induced bronchospasm can occur.
As with other beta-mimetics, nausea, vomiting, sweating, weakness and myalgia/muscle cramps may occur. In rare cases decrease in diastolic blood pressure, increase in systolic blood pressure, arrhythmias, particularly after higher doses, may occur.
In individual cases psychological alterations have been reported under inhalation therapy with beta-mimetics.
The most frequent non-respiratory anticholinergic related adverse events are dryness of mouth and dysphonia.
There have been isolated reports of ocular complications (i.e. mydriasis, increased intraocular pressure, angle-closure glaucoma, and eye pain) when aerosolised ipratropium bromide either alone or in combination with adrenergic beta2-agonist, has escaped into the eyes. Ocular side effects, gastrointestinal motility disturbances and urinary retention may occur in rare cases and are reversible.

Precaution: May cause paradoxical bronchospasm. Caution when used in patients who are sensitive to sympathomimetic agents.

	Indication:  Iron deficiency anaemia



Dose: Parenteral
Iron-deficiency anaemia
Adult: As a preparation containing the equivalent of 50 mg/ml of iron. Total dose (ml) = 0.0442 (desired haemoglobin - observed haemoglobin) x LBW + (0.26 x LBW) (Note: LBW = Lean body weight(kg)) A test dose of 0.5 ml should be given and observe patient for at least 1 hr for signs for hypersensitivity. Usual daily max: 2 ml (100 mg). Total dose may be given in divided doses on a daily or twice wkly basis via IM inj (into the upper outer quadrant of the buttock); may also be given intravenously by total-dose infusion or as divided inj.

Child: As a preparation containing the equivalent of 50 mg/ml of iron. Total dose (ml) = 0.0442 (desired haemoglobin - observed haemoglobin) x LBW + (0.26 x LBW) (Note: LBW = Lean body weight(kg)) A test dose (<10 kg: 0.2 ml; 10-20 kg: 0.3 ml) should be given and observe the patient for at least 1 hr for signs of hypersensitivity. Usual daily max: <5 kg: Up to 0.5 ml (25 mg); 5-9 kg: Up to 1 ml (50 mg); larger children: 2 ml (100 mg). Total dose may be given in divided doses on a daily or twice wkly basis via IM inj (into the upper outer quadrant of the buttock); may also be given intravenously by total-dose infusion or as divided inj.



Intravenous drip infusion:

It must be diluted only in 0.9% sodium chloride solution (normal saline) or in 5% glucose solution. In a dose of 100-200 mg iron (2-4ml) may be diluted in 100 ml. On each occasion the first 25 mg of iron should be infused over a period of 15 minutes. If no adverse reactions occur during this time the remaining portion of the infusion should be given at an infusion rate of not more than 100 ml in 30 minutes.

Intravenous injection:

It may be administered in a dose of 100 – 200 mg iron (2-4 ml) by slow intravenous injection (0.2 ml/min) preferably diluted in 10 – 20 ml 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% glucose solution. On each occasion before administering a slow intravenous injection, 25 mg of iron should be injected slowly over a period of 1 to 2 minutes. If no adverse reactions occur within 15 minutes, the remaining portion of the injection may be given. 

Contra-indication: Known serious hypersensitivity to other parenteral iron products.

Non-iron deficiency anaemia (e.g. haemolytic anaemia).

Iron overload or disturbances in utilisation of iron (e.g. haemochromatosis, haemosiderosis).

Decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatitis.

Acute or chronic infection, because parenteral iron administration may exacerbate bacterial or viral infections.

Acute renal failure. 

Side effects: Anaphylactoid reactions are uncommon and include urticaria, rashes, itching, nausea and shivering. Administration must be stopped immediately when signs of an anaphylactoid reaction are observed.

Acute, severe anaphylactoid reactions are very rare. They usually occur within the first few minutes of administration and are generally characterised by the sudden onset of respiratory difficulty and / or cardiovascular collapse; fatalities have been reported.

Delayed reactions are well described and may be severe. They are characterised by arthralgia, myalgia and sometimes fever. The onset varies from several hours up to four days after administration. Symptoms usually last two to four days and settle spontaneously or following the use of simple analgesics.

Exacerbation of joint pain in rheumatoid arthritis can occur. Local reactions reported are soreness and inflammation at or near injection site and local phlebitic reaction.

Local complications at the injection site after intramuscular injection such as staining of the skin, bleeding, formation of sterile abscesses, tissue necrosis or atrophy and pain are observed.

Precaution: Parenterally administered iron preparations can cause hypersensitivity reactions including serious and potentially fatal anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported after previously uneventful doses of parenteral iron complexes.

The risk is enhanced for patients with known allergies including drug allergies, including patients with a history of severe asthma, eczema or other atopic allergy.

Hypotensive episodes may occur if intravenous injection is administered too rapidly.

Mode of action: Iron dextran is used for the treatment of iron-deficiency anaemia where oral therapy is ineffective or impracticable. Released iron replaces the depleted iron stores in the bone marrow where it is used in the synthesis of haemoglobin.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Reduced Fe absorption upon oral Fe administration earlier than 5 days after the last inj. Reduced effect when used with chloramphenicol.ACI	Mylovit CAP  100's pack 302 BDT

Contra-indication: Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients, haemolytic anemia.

Side effects: Allergic sensitization has been reported following oral administration. May cause constipation.

Precaution: Iron chelates with antacid and tetracycline and absorption of all these may be impaired. 

Mode of action: Iron: Essential component in the formation of hemoglobin; adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropoiesis; also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport. Replacement of iron stores found in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and enzymes; works to transport oxygen via hemoglobin.
Folic acid: Required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis; folic acid is converted in the liver and plasma to its metabolically active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, by dihydrofolate reductase; prevents neural tube defects in women of childbearing potential and higher doses required during pregnancy.
Vitamin B: Plays a role in the synthesis and maintenance of coenzyme A. Necessary for lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, tissue respiration, glycogenolysis, inhibition of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. May increaase chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. 
Vitamin C is necessary for collagen formation and tissue repair; plays a role in oxidation/reduction reactions as well as other metabolic pathways including synthesis of catecholamines, carnitine, and steroids; also plays a role in conversion of folic acid to folinic acid.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction: Iron: Antacids may decrease the absorption of carbonyl iron.

Folic acid: Antiepileptics, oral contraceptives, anti-TB drugs, alcohol, aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim and sulphonamides may result to decrease in serum folate contrations. Decreases serum phenytoin concentrations.

	Indication: Vitamin/mineral deficiency during pregnancy and lactation

Dose: Adults (persons over 12 years of age), One (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician. Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12.

Contra-indication:  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms.

Side effects:  Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn and vomiting) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Reducing the dose and administering it with meals will minimize these effects in the sensitive patient. Increasing fiber in the diet can relieve constipation. Iron may turn stools black. This is a harmless effect that is a result of unabsorbed iron. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Integra FTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Integra FTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime.

Precaution: General: Anemia is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes. No single regimen fits all cases and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential. Blood examinations including hemoglobin and hematacrit should be done at the usual intervals to make certain that therapy is adequate. Use with care in the presence of peptic ulcer, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg -0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

Mode of action: Iron: Essential component in the formation of hemoglobin; adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropoiesis; also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport. Replacement of iron stores found in hemoglobin, myoglobin, and enzymes; works to transport oxygen via hemoglobin.
Folic acid: Required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis; folic acid is converted in the liver and plasma to its metabolically active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, by dihydrofolate reductase; prevents neural tube defects in women of childbearing potential and higher doses required during pregnancy.
Zinc: Cofactor in over 100 enzymes; plays a role in DNA synthesis; supports a healthy immune system; helps maintain a sense of smell and taste; may assist in porper function of insulin.
Vitamin B: Plays a role in the synthesis and maintenance of coenzyme A. Necessary for lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, tissue respiration, glycogenolysis, inhibition of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. May increaase chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin): Required for the maintenance of normal erthropoiesis, nucleprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth; intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric mucosa, is required for active absorption of Vitamin B12 from the GI tract. Necessary for normal tissue respiration; plays a role in activation of pyridoxine and conversion of tryptophan to niacin.
Vitamin C is necessary for collagen formation and tissue repair; plays a role in oxidation/reduction reactions as well as other metabolic pathways including synthesis of catecholamines, carnitine, and steroids; also plays a role in conversion of folic acid to folinic acid.

Pediatric Patients

The ratio of the drugs may not be appropriate in pediatric patients under the age of 15 (e.g., higher mg/kg doses of isoniazid are usually given in pediatric patients than adults).

The tablets should be given as a single dose, preferably on an empty stomach, at least 30 min before breakfast to ensure a high peak serum concentration.
Tablets are recommended in the initial intensive phase of the short course treatment of tuberculosis. During this phase which lasts for 2 months,

Contra-indication: Known or suspected hypersensitivity to rifamycins and/or to isoniazid and to pyrazinamide and/or to any of the excipients including a history of drug-induced hepatitis, acute liver diseases regardless of their origin, and peripheral neuritis.

Side effects: Unwanted effects which may occur during continuous daily or intermittent therapy: Rifampicin: Rifampicin may cause reddish discolouration of body fluids and occasionally other body secretions eg, urine, sputum, lacrimal fluid, faeces, saliva and sweat. It may permanently discolour soft contact lenses.
Hepatic Effects: Very common (>10%) is an asymptomatic increase in liver enzymes; severe life-threatening hepatic reactions eg, hepatic failure and acute fulminant hepatitis are uncommon (>0.1% and <1%). In isolated cases (<0.01%), a fatal outcome was observed.
Renal Effects: Elevations of BUN and serum uric acid, haemolysis, haematuria, interstitial nephritis, renal insufficiency.
Gastrointestinal Effects: Nausea, abdominal pains, vomiting or diarrhoea, pseudomembranous colitis.
Central and Peripheral Nervous System Effects: Tiredness, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, ataxia, mental confusion, muscular weakness, visual disturbances.
Haematological Changes: Leucopenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenic purpura.
Effects on Skin and Appendages: Flushing, itching with or without skin rash, urticaria, reddening of the eyes, exudative conjunctivitis or generalised hypersensitivity reactions involving the skin eg, exfoliative dermatitis, Lyell's syndrome and pemphigoid reactions.
Endocrine Effects: Disturbances in the menstrual cycle, induction of crisis in Addison patients.
Unwanted effects chiefly occurring during intermittent therapy or upon resumption of treatment after temporary interruption:

Precaution: Caution is advised in patients with impaired renal or liver function, diabetes mellitus, chronic alcoholism and undernourished patients, patients with a history of gout and patients suffering from convulsive disorders and acute porphyria. Precautions need to be taken: Blood counts and liver function tests (SGPT, SGOT) should be performed periodically (especially in prolonged treatment) and at baseline, if possible.
Patients with current chronic liver disease or impaired liver function should be treated with caution and under strict medical supervision. Careful monitoring of liver function should be carried out and attention should be paid to possible prodromal symptoms of hepatitis eg, fatigue, weakness, malaise, anorexia, nausea or vomiting. If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, treatment should be discontinued promptly. The occurrence of severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated may develop even after many months of treatment.

Mode of action: Rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide are all active bactericidal antituberculosis drugs. Rifampicin and isoniazid are particularly active against the rapidly growing extracellular organisms and have an intracellular bactericidal activity. Rifampicin also inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells and it has activity against slow and intermittently-growing M tuberculosis. Pyrazinamide, particularly in the acid pH environment of macrophages is active against intracellular organisms. Combination of these agents covers activity against the 3 different bacterial populations.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Rifampicin may reduce effectivity of hormonal contraceptives, ACE inhibitors (e.g. enalapril, imidapril), antiemetics (e.g. aprepitant), antineoplastics (e.g. imatinib), diuretics (e.g. eplerenone), drugs for erectile dysfunction (e.g. tadalafil), oral hypoglycaemics (e.g. nateglinide, repaglinide), NSAIDs (e.g. etoricoxib). Rifampicin may reduce serum levels of atovaquone, ketoconazole. Antacids may reduce absorption of rifampicin. Anaesthetics and halothane may increase risk for hepatotoxicity w/ rifampicin and isoniazid. 

Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin and theophylline; and may decrease carbamazepine metabolism. Stavudine may increase risk of distal sensory neuropathy w/ isoniazid. Antacids may reduce isoniazid absorption. May increase plasma levels of isoniazid w/ para-aminosalicylic acid. Increased risk of CNS toxicity when isoniazid is used concomitantly w/ cycloserine. 

Pyrazinamide antagonizes the effects of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone.

Potentially Fatal: Concominant use w/ saquinavir/ritonavir may increase risk of severe hepatotoxicity. May reduce antiviral efficacy of atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavirAcme Ltd.	Isorifam 150 CAP 100/150 100's pack 397 BDT

Endocrine Effects: Disturbances in the menstrual cycle, induction of crisis in Addison patients. Unwanted effects chiefly occurring during intermittent therapy or upon resumption of treatment after temporary interruption:

Precaution: All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction. If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symptoms have cleared. The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction.

Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following:

    Daily users of alcohol. Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of isoniazid hepatitis.
    Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction.
    Age > 35.
    Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication.
    History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid.
    Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy.
    Pregnancy.
    Injection drug use.
    Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period.
    HIV seropositive patients.


Mode of action: Rifampicin and isoniazid are active bactericidal anti-TB drugs which are particularly active against the rapidly growing extracellular organisms and also have bactericidal activity intracellularly. Rifampicin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts w/ bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. Cross-resistance to rifampicin has only been shown w/ other rifamycins. It has activity against slow- and intermittently-growing M. tuberculosis. Isoniazid acts against actively growing tubercle bacilli.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: May reduce effectivity of hormonal contraceptives. Reduced absorption w/ antacids. May decrease plasma concentrations of antivirals (e.g. atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir), atovaquone w/ rifampicin.

	Indication: Candidiasis, Fungal infections, Pityriasis versicolor, Seborrhoeic dermatitis							


Dose: Adult: PO Fungal infections 200 mg once daily, up to 400 mg once daily if needed. Usual duration: 14 days and for at least 1 wk after symptoms have cleared and cultures have become negative. 

Chronic vag candidiasis 400 mg once daily for 5 days. 

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity; preexisting liver disease, porphyria. Concurrent use with cisapride, terfenadine or astemizole.

Side effects: GI disturbances e.g. nausea and vomiting; rash, dermatitis, burning sensation, pruritus; headache, dizziness, somnolence, fever and chills; thrombocytopenia; gynaecomastia, impotence; raised intracranial pressure; photophobia; transient elevations in LFTs.
Potentially Fatal: Hepatotoxicity.

Precaution: Hepatic impairment; monitor liver function regularly. Pregnancy, lactation. Predisposition to adrenocortical insufficiency. Discontinue treatment if there is persistent or worsening of liver enzyme elevation.

Mode of action: Ketoconazole interferes w/ biosynthesis of triglycerides and phopholipids by blocking fungal CYP450, thus altering cell membrane permeability in susceptible fungi. It also inhibits other fungal enzymes resulting in the accumulation of toxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Reduced absorption w/ antimuscarinics, antacids, H2-blockers, PPIs, sucralfate. Reduced plasma concentrations w/ rifampicin, isoniazid, efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin. May also reduce concentrations of isoniazid and rifampicin. May reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives. May increase serum levels of CYP3A4 substrates e.g. digoxin, oral anticoagulants, sildenafil, tacrolimus.
Potentially Fatal: May potentiate and prolong sedative and hypnotic effects of midazolam and triazolam. Increased plasma levels and prolonged QT intervals of astemizole, cisapride, dofetilide, pimozide, quinidine and terfenadine which may lead to torsade de pointes. Increased risk of myopathy w/ HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g. lovastatin, simvastatin). Markedly increased plasma levels of nisoldipine. Increased risk of hyperkalaemia and hypotension w/ eplerenone. Increased risk of vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischaemia w/ ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine, dihydroergotamine).Aristopharma	Ketozol Shampoo   60ml pack 175 BDT

	Indication: Dandruff, Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, Pityriasis versicolor

Dose: To use the Ketoconazole  shampoo, follow these steps: Use a small amount of water to wet the area where Ketoconazole  shampoo is to be applied. Apply the shampoo to the affected skin/scalp and a large area around it. Use fingers to rub the shampoo until it forms lather. Leave the shampoo on skin/scalp for 5 minutes. Rinse the shampoo off skin/scalp with water. 

Treatment: Pityriasis versicolor: once daily for 5 days. 
Seborrhoeic dermatitis and Pityriasis capitis: twice weekly for 2 to 4 weeks.

Prophylaxis: Pityriasis versicolor: once daily for 3 days during a single treatment course before the summer. Seborrhoeic dermatitis and Pityriasis capitis: once every 1 or 2 weeks.

Contra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to ketoconazole or any of the excipients.

Side effects: Topical treatment with Ketoconazole 2% shampoo is generally well tolerated. As with other shampoos, a local burning sensation, itching, or contact dermatitis (due to irritation or allergy), may occur on exposed areas. In rare instances, mainly in patients with chemically damaged hair or gray hair, a discoloration of the hair has been observed with the use of Ketoconazole 2% shampoo.

Precaution: In patients who have been on prolonged treatment with topical corticosteroids, it is recommended that the steroid therapy be gradually withdrawn over a period of 2 to 3 weeks, while using Ketoconazole 2% shampoo to prevent any potential rebound effect. Avoid contact with the eyes. If the shampoo enters the eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water.

Mode of action: Ketoconazole interferes w/ biosynthesis of triglycerides and phopholipids by blocking fungal CYP450, thus altering cell membrane permeability in susceptible fungi. It also inhibits other fungal enzymes resulting in the accumulation of toxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.

	Indication: Constipation, Hepatic encephalopathy

Dose: Constipation:
Adults: Initially 15 ml twice daily, adjusted according to patient's need.
Children: Under 1 year: 2.5 ml twice daily
1-5 years: 5 ml twice daily
5-10 years: 10 ml twice daily

Hepatic encephalopathy: 30-50 ml 3 times daily, subsequently adjusted to produce 2-3 soft stools daily.

Contra-indication: Lactulose is contraindicated in patients with galactosaemia and intestinal obstruction.

Side effects: Initial dosing may produce flatulence and intestinal cramps, which are usually transient. Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhoea.

Precaution: It should be used with caution in patients with lactose intolerance and diabetes.

Mode of action: Lactulose promotes peristalsis by producing an osmotic effect in the colon with resultant distention. In hepatic encephalopathy, it reduces absorption of ammonium ions and toxic nitrogenous compounds, resulting in reduced blood ammonia concentrations.

Precaution: Safe use of leuprolide acetate or norethindrone acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Before starting treatment with LUPRON DEPOT, pregnancy must be excluded.

When used monthly at the recommended dose, LUPRON DEPOT usually inhibits ovulation and stops menstruation. Contraception is not insured, however, by taking LUPRON DEPOT. Therefore, patients should use non-hormonal methods of contraception.

Patients should be advised to see their physician if they believe they may be pregnant. If a patient becomes pregnant during treatment, the drug must be discontinued and the patient must be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus.

During the early phase of therapy, sex steroids temporarily rise above baseline because of the physiologic effect of the drug. Therefore, an increase in clinical signs and symptoms may be observed during the initial days of therapy, but these will dissipate with continued therapy.
Norethindrone acetate treatment should be discontinued if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, medication should be withdrawn.


Mode of action: Leuprorelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. Following an initial stimulation of gonadotrophins, continuous admin of Leuprorelin leads to down regulation of GnRH receptors and subsequently reduces pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. Reduced gonadotrophin levels lead to inhibition of sex hormone (testosterone and oestrogen) production. Within 2-4 wk after treatment initiation, testosterone levels in male may be reduced to below castrate threshold.

Mode of action: Levobupivacaine is a long acting local anaesthetic of the amide type. It is the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. It blocks nerve conduction in sensory and motor nerves mainly by interacting with voltage sensitive sodium channels on the cell membrane. It also interferes with impulse transmission and conduction in other tissues. Levobupivacaine is given as the hydrochloride for infiltration anaesthesia and regional nerve blocks including epidural block. It is contraindicated in obstetric paracervical block and IV regional anaesthesia (Bier's block). The 0.75% solution is also contraindicated for epidural blocks in obstetrics.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Plasma levels may be reduced when used with enzyme-inducing drugs such as rifampicin. Substrates for or inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 may affect the plasma levels of levobupivacaine.ACI	Cartine TAB dr 330mg 30's pack 150 BDT

Dose: Adults: Tablet: 330 mg two or three times daily. 
Infants and children: 50 to 100 mg/kg/day in divided doses, with a maximum of 3 g/day. Dosage should begin at 50 mg/kg/day. The exact dosage will depend on clinical response.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Generally Levocarnitine is well tolerated. However, few side effects including transient nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhoea may occur

Precaution: Gastrointestinal reactions may result from a too rapid consumption of Levocarnitine.
The safety and efficacy of oral levocarnitine has not been evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. Chronic administration of high doses of oral levocarnitine in patients with severely compromised renal function or in ESRD patients on dialysis may result in accumulation of the potentially toxic metabolites, trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), since these metabolites are normally excreted in the urine

Mode of action: Quaternary ammonium compound found in all mammalian tissue (particularly striated muscle).

Important for lipid catabolism; essential for FFA transport from cytosol to mitochondria where they are oxidized.

	Indication: Parkinson's disease and 'end of dose' motor fluctuations not controlled by levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor combinations.

Dose: Adult: PO Per tab contains levodopa and carbidopa in a ratio of 4:1 w/ entacapone 200 mg. Initial: 1 tab/day. Titrate dose according to patient's response. Recommended to take only 1 tab per dose administration. Max: 8 tabs/day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity. Narrow angle glaucoma. Should not be used in patients with suspicious, undiagnosed skin lesions or a history ot melanoma.

Side effects: Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hallucinations, hyperpyrexia and confusion. Fibrotic complications. Dark colour (red, brown or black) may appear in bodily secretions such as sweat, saliva and urine. Possible increase in dyskinesia. Chest pain, asthenia, cardiac irregularities, angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, back pain, shoulder pain and muscle cramps.
Potentially Fatal: Rhabdomyolysis.

Precaution: Periodic monitoring of hepatic, renal, haematopoietic and CV functions in patients on prolonged therapy. Monitor for changes in IOP in patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma. Caution when used in patients with biliary obstruction. Caution when interpreting plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites. Withdrawal should be gradual.

Mode of action: Levodopa is the metabolic precurosor of dopamine, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain. Carbidopa increases the amount of levodopa that is transported into the CNS by inhibiting the decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. Entacapone is a selective inhibitor of catechol-o-methyltransferase. Given concurrently, entacapone results in greater and more substained plasma levels of levodopa, leading to greater control of parkinsonism symptoms.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased risk of postural hypotension when used concurrently with hypotensive drugs. Severe orthostatic hypotension may result from concurrent usage with MAOIs. Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, phenytoin or papaverine may reduce the efficacy of levodopa. Iron salts may reduce the bioavailability. Concurrent usage with drugs that interfere with biliary excretion may lead to increased plasma levels of entacapone. May depress prolactin secretion and increase growth hormone levels.ACI	Leflox TAB dr 500mg 20's pack 302.20 BDT

As adjunct to local infiltration anesth in genital mucous membranes: Apply 1 g per 10 cm2 of the skin surface for 15 mins. 
For superficial minor surgery of genital mucous membranes in adult females: Apply 5-10 g for 5-10 mins.

Contra-indication: Neonates with gestational age <37 wk. Infants <12 mth of age who are receiving treatment with methaemoglobin-inducing agents or children who are receiving medications associated with drug-induced methaemoglobinemia. Children with congenital or idiopathic methaemoglobinemia. Application on mucous membranes, broken or inflamed skin.

Side effects: Hyperpigmentation, erythema, itching, rash, burning, urticaria, stinging, oedema.

Precaution: Caution when used over large areas and leaving on for >2 hr. Severe hepatic impairment. Caution when used in patients who are receiving class I and III antiarrhythmics. Dose reduction may be necessary in acutely ill, debilitated patients and elderly. Avoid using on open wounds or near the eyes. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Lidocaine and prilocaine are local anaesthetic agents of the amide type. Both work by stabilising the neuronal membranes and inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby giving rise to the anaesthetic action.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Increased risk of toxicity when used with drugs that are known to cause methaemoglobinaemia. Concurrent use with class III antiarrhythmics may lead to additive cardiac effects. Toxic effects may be additive when used with class I antiarrhythmics.Gonoshasthaya	G Lignocaine 2% Injection 20mg/ml 2ml amp x 10's pack/50 ml vial x 1's pack 27.60 / 18.27 BDT

Consideration may be given to the use of 10 mg/kg in every eight hours regimen in neonates with a sub-optimal clinical response. All neonatal patients should receive 10 mg/kg t.i.d. by 7 days of life.

Contra-indication: Linzolid formulations are contraindicated for use in patients who have known hypersensitivity to Linzolid or any of the other product components. Linzolid should not be used in patients taking any medicinal product which inhibits monoamine oxidases A or B (e.g. phenelzine, isocarboxazid) or within two weeks of taking any such medicinal product. Linzolid should not be administered to patients with uncontrolled hypertension, pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, carcinoid syndrome and/or patients taking directly and indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents (e.g. pseudoephedrine), vasopressive agents (e.g. epinephrine, norepinephrine), dopaminergic agents (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine), serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine or buspirone.

Side effects: Most of the adverse events reported with Linzolid were mild to moderate in intensity. The most common adverse events in patients treated with Linzolid were diarrhea, headache and nausea. Other adverse included oral moniliasis, vaginal moniliasis, hypertension, dyspepsia, localized abdominal pain, pruritus, and tongue discoloration.

Precaution: Patients who develop recurrent nausea or vomiting, unexplained acidosis, or low bicarbonate level while receiving Linzolid should receive immediate medical evaluation. Where administration of Linzolid and concomitant serotonergic agents is clinically appropriate, patients should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as cognitive dysfunction, hyperpyrexia, hyper reflexia and incoordination. If signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents. If the concomitant serotonergic agent is withdrawn, discontinuation symptoms can be observed. If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment, such as changes in visual acuity, changes in color vision, blurred vision, or visual field defect, prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended. Convulsions have been reported in patients when treated with Linzolid. In some of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures was reported.

Mode of action: Linezolid is a bacteriostatic oxazolidinone which acts by inhibiting ribosomal protein synthesis. It is active against gm+ve bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci and MRSA. It has limited in vitro activity against gm-ve bacteria.

Contra-indication: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting is present; children <3 yr.

Side effects: Anal irritation (excessive dose) and seepage. Foreign-body granulomatous reactions; vasospasm; lipoid pneumonia; interference with absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. 

Precaution: Oral: not recommended for use in patients with difficulty swallowing or impaired neurodevelopment. Avoid prolonged use as a laxative or faecal softener. 

Mode of action: Paraffin: When taken orally: penetrates and softens faecal material. Magnesium hydroxide increases peristaltic activity causing osmotic retention of fluids, thus resulting in bowel evacuation. It also reduces stomach acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid to form Mg chloride.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction: May impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and possibly other compounds.Novo Nordisk	Victoza Injection 3ml 1's  pack 7850 BDT
	Indication: Type 2 diabetes

Dose: It can be administered once daily at any time of day, independently of meals, and can be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment.

For all patients  should be initiated with a dose of 0.6 mg per day for one week. The 0.6 mg dose is a starting dose intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms during initial titration, and is not effective for glycemic control. After one week at 0.6 mg per day, the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. If the 1.2 mg dose does not result in acceptable glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg.

When initiating , consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia

Contra-indication: Do not use in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).

Do not use in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to   any of the product components.

Side effects: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Precaution: In the clinical trials, there have been 6 reported cases of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia among Victoza-treated patients and 2 cases in comparator-treated patients (1.3 vs. 1.0 cases per 1000 patient-years). One comparator-treated patient with MTC had pre-treatment serum calcitonin concentrations >1000 ng/L suggesting pre-existing disease. All of these cases were diagnosed after thyroidectomy, which was prompted by abnormal results on routine, protocol-specified measurements of serum calcitonin. Five of the six Victoza-treated patients had elevated calcitonin concentrations at baseline and throughout the trial. One Victoza and one non-Victoza-treated patient developed elevated calcitonin concentrations while on treatment. 

Mode of action: Incretin mimetic; analogue of human glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1); acts as GLP-1 receptor agonist to increase insulin secretion in the presence of elevated blood glucose; delays gastric emptying to decrease postprandial glucose; also decreases glucagon secretion.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Oral Contraceptives: Liraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. Tmax was delayed by 1.5 hrs with liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of either ethinyloestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide.

Warfarin: No interaction study has been performed. Upon initiation of Liraglutide treatment in patients on warfarin more frequent monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) is recommended.

Insulin: Combination of Liraglutide with insulin has not been evaluated.

Incompatibilities: Substances added to Liraglutide may cause degradation of liraglutide. In the absence of compatibility studies, Liraglutide must not be mixed with other medicinal products.ACI	Stril TAB dr 5mg 28's pack 84.56 BDT

Precaution: Avoid exposure to direct sunlight & UV light. Renal & hepatic impairment.

Mode of action: Tetracyclines provide bacteriostatic action at the available plasma and tissue concentrations and are effective against intracellular and extracellular organisms. Their mechanism of action is based on an inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis. Tetracyclines block the access of the bacterial aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex by binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome, thus preventing the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain in protein synthesis. When given at therapeutically attainable concentrations their toxic effect is limited to the bacterial cells.

The exact mechanisms by which tetracyclines reduce lesions of acne vulgaris have not been fully elucidated; however, the effect appears to result in part from the antibacterial activity of the drugs. Following oral administration, the drugs inhibit the growth of susceptible organisms (mainly Propionibacterium acnes) on the surface of the skin and reduce the concentration of free fatty acids in sebum. The reduction in free fatty acids in sebum may be an indirect result of the inhibition of lipase-producing organisms which convert triglycerides into free fatty acids or may be a direct result of interference with lipase production in these organisms. Free fatty acids are comedogenic and are believed to be a possible cause of the inflammatory lesions, e.g. papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, of acne. 

However, other mechanisms also appear to be involved because clinical improvement of acne vulgaris with oral tetracycline therapy does not necessarily correspond with a reduction in the bacterial flora of the skin or a decrease in the free fatty acid content of sebum.

Mode of action: Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives.

Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion.

Sodium bicarbonate raises blood and urinary pH by dissociation to provide bicarbonate ions, which neutralises the hydrogen ion concentration. It also neutralises gastric acid via production of carbon dioxide.

 Polyethylene glycol : Osmotic laxative; causes water retention in stool, causing increase in stool frequency.

Dose: Suspension: 2-4 teaspoonfuls after 20-60 minutes of meal and before sleep or on the basis of physician’s prescription.

Contra-indication: Magaldrate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to magnesium and aluminium. It is also contraindicated in patients with impaired renal functions.

Side effects: GI side-effects are uncommon. Occasionally, if excessive amount is consumed, diarrhea, constipation or regurgitation may occur.

Precaution: Care should be taken in decreased kidney function, hypophosphataemia and weak people.

Mode of action: Magaldrate is a hydroxymagnesium aluminate complex that is rapidly converted in gastric acid to magnesium and aluminium hydroxide, which is poorly absorbed and provides a sustained antacid effect with balanced efects on intestinal motility; increases lower esophageal sphincter tone and inhibits smooth muscle contraction and gastric emptying.

Simethicone allows gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines to come together more easily, which allows for easier passage of gas.


Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Magaldrate may negatively influence drugs like tetracyclines, benzodiazepines, and indomethacin. High doses or prolonged usage may lead to an increment of defecation and a reduction in feces consistence. In some cases it can alter the functionality of the gastrointestinal tract, occasionally provoking constipation or diarrhea.Beximco	Digecid Plus Chewable TAB dr 480 mg + 20 mg   BDT

	Indication: Pneumonia, Meningitis, Septicemia, Septic Arthritis, Meningococcemia, Carditis

Dose: The recommended dose for vaccines in all age groups is 0.5mL, administered as a single dose. Administer a 0.5 mL dose vaccine by subcutaneous injection.  

Withdraw the 0.5 mL dose of vaccine from the single-dose vial using a sterile needle and syringe.

Contra-indication: Severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide-, diphtheria toxoid- or CRM197-containing vaccine, or to any component of Menactra vaccine

Side effects: Local and systemic adverse reactions especially febrile reactions may be encountered more frequently in children than in adults.Irritability, drowsiness, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms e.g. nau sea, vomiting and diarrhoea, local axillary lymphadenopathy. Very common: erythema, induration, tenderness, pain and redness at the injection site, fatigue, malaise. 

Precaution:  1. Guillain-Barré Syndrome

Persons previously diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) may be at increased risk of GBS following receipt of Menactra vaccine. The decision to give Menactra vaccine should take into account the potential benefits and risks.

GBS has been reported in temporal relationship following administration of Menactra vaccine.  The risk of GBS following Menactra vaccination was evaluated in a post-marketing retrospective cohort study .

 2. Preventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions

Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for possible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions to allow an assessment of benefits and risks. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the control of immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute anaphylactic reaction occur.

 3. Altered Immunocompetence

Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to Menactra vaccine.

 4. Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness

This vaccine may not protect all recipients.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: This can be administered at the same time as other vaccines. Different injectable vaccines should always be administered at a different injection site.
Incompatibilities: In the absence of compatibility studies, this vaccine must not be mixed with other medicinal products.Indication: Infertility, Assisted reproductive technologies, Polycystic ovarian disease, In vitro fertilisation procedures

Dose: Unless prescribed otherwise, doses are as follows: Sterility in Females: The dosage of HMG for the induction of follicle growth in normo- or hypogonadotrophic women varies according to the individual. The amount depends on ovarian reaction and should be checked by ultrasound examinations of the ovaries and measuring estradiol levels. If the HMG dosage is too high for the treated individual, multiple uni- and bilateral follicle growth can occur. HMG is administered IM or SC and in general, the therapy is begun with a daily dosage corresponding to 75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH daily. If the ovaries do not respond, the dosage can slowly be increased until a rise in estradiol secretion and follicle growth is evident. Treatment with the same dosage of HMG continues until the preovulatory estradiol serum level is attained. If the level rises too quickly, the dosage should be reduced. To induce ovulation, hCG 5000 or 10,000 IU are injected IM 1-2 days after the last HMG administration. Note: After administering a HMG dosage which is too high for the corresponding individual, a subsequent hCG administration can cause an unintentional hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Sterility in Males: Initially, 3 x 1000 and 3000 IU hCG a week are administered until a normal testosterone serum level is reached. Then, an additional dose of HMG 3 x (75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH)/week is administered IM for a few months.

Contra-indication: Females: Pregnancy, enlargement of the ovaries or cysts that is not caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome, gynaecological bleeding of unknown cause and tumors in the uterus, ovaries and breasts.
Males: Carcinoma of the prostate and tumors in the testes.
The following conditions must be properly treated before therapy with HMG is begun: Dysfunctions of the thyroid gland and of the cortex of the suprarenal gland, a rise in the serum level of prolactin with different causes (hyperprolactinaemia), tumors in the pituitary gland (hypophysis) or in part of the diencephalon (hypothalamus).

Side effects: Occasionally, nausea and vomiting can occur.
In single cases, hypersensitivity reactions and fever can occur during treatment with HMG. The administration of Menogon may lead to reactions at the injection site: Reddening, pain, swelling and itching. In very rare cases, long-term usage can lead to the formation of antibodies, making the therapy ineffective.
Treatment with HMG can often lead to ovarian hyperstimulation that first becomes clinically relevant after the administration of hCG (pregnancy hormone) to induce ovulation. This can lead to the formation of large ovarian cysts that tend to rupture and to intra-abdominal bleeding.
In addition, the accumulation of fluids in the abdominal cavity (ascites), the accumulation of fluids in the chest cavity (hydrothorax), a decrease in the excretion of urine (oliguria), lowering of the blood pressure (hypotension), and occlusion of blood vessels by blood clots (thromboembolic phenomena) can occur. Treatment should be immediately discontinued when the first signs of hyperstimulation appear: Abdominal pain and a palpable (by the physician) enlargement in the lower abdomen, which can be detected sonographically.
If abdominal pain occurs, see the doctor.
With pregnancy, these side effects can intensify, continue over a long period of time, and be life threatening.
Unintentional multiple pregnancies occur more often during treatment with HMG.

Precaution: hCG should not be administered to induce ovulation in females whose ovaries have unintentionally been hyperstimulated.
When treating sterile women, ovarian activity should be checked (ultrasound and estradiol levels in serum response) prior to HMG administration. During treatment, these tests should be carried out every 1-2 days until stimulation occurs. Ovarian reaction can also be measured using a cervix index. Close supervision is imperative during treatment. Treatment should be immediately discontinued if unintentional hyperstimulation occurs.
Further remarks concerning the steps to be taken when ovarian hyperstimulation has occurred can be found under Actions.

Mode of action: Menotrophins, a purified extract of human post-menopausal urine, contain follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) in a ratio of 1:1. The biological effectiveness of menotrophins is mainly due to its FSH content. In the ovaries, the FSH-component increases the quantity of growing follicles and stimulates their development. Under the influence of LH, FSH increases oestradiol production in the granulosa cells. In the testes, FSH induces the maturation of Sertoli cells and the seminal canals and the development of the spermatozoa.

Counsel patients to report any unexplained bleeding, bruising, purpura, sore throat, fever or malaise during treatment; perform blood count and stop treatment if blood dyscrasias suspected. Counsel patients taking delayed release tablets to report repeatedly unbroken or partially broken tablets in their faeces. Pyloric stenosis may delay release into colon.

Mode of action: Mesalazine is considered to be the active moiety of sulfasalazine. The mechanism of action is uncertain, but may be due to its ability to inhibit local chemical mediators of the inflammatory response especially leukotriene synthesis in the GI mucosa. Action may be topical in terminal ileum and colon rather than systemic.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Do not give with lactulose or other drugs which lower pH for they prevent release of mesalazine. May decrease digoxin absorption.Sanofi Aventis (BD) Ltd.	Uromitexan Injection 400mg/4ml 15's pack 4474.50 BDT

Dose: Intravenous
Prophylaxis against urothelial toxicity
Adult: Refer to individual and local protocol. Dose calculated according to cytotoxic dose. Normally given at a dose >cytotoxic dose. Duration of treatment should be as long as cytotoxic treatment; plus the time it takes for concentration of antineoplastic metabolites in urine to fall. Administered either by short (15-30 minutes) or continuous (24 hr) infusion.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to thiol-containing compounds.

Side effects: Nausea, vomiting, colic, diarrhoea, anorexia, dyspepsia, unpleasant taste, constipation; headache, malaise, fatigue, depression, irritability, somnolence, hyperaesthesia, dizziness, confusion; rash, pruritus, generalised urticaria, alopecia, inj site reactions, flushing; leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, granulocytopenia, chest pain, oedema (peripheral, facial and periorbital), hypotension, tachycardia, hypertension, increased heart rate, ST-segment elevation; dyspnoea, coughing, pneumonia, tachypnea; fever; hypocalcaemia; increased sweating; back pain, limb pain, myalgia; increased hepatic enzyme concentrations; pharyngitis; ulceration of mucous membranes. In patients receiving oral and/or IV mesna and were specifically not treated with concurrent cytotoxic therapy: flatulence; rhinitis; rigors; back pain; rash; conjunctivitis; arthralgia. Inhalation: bronchospasm.
Potentially Fatal: May cause haemorrhagic cystitis, systemic anaphylactic reactions.

Precaution: Protective effect applies only to the urinary tract; pregnancy, lactation. Patients with auto-immune disorders. IV formulation may contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative; avoid in neonates or infants. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if discolouration of urine occurs. During treatment, monitor urine for erythrocytes and haematuria. Maintain adequate hydration in all patients. Patients who vomit within 2 hr of oral dose should repeat dose or receive IV dose.

Mode of action: Mesna is used to prevent urothelial toxicity associated with oxazaphosphorine, ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide. It acts in the kidney; reacting with thiol groups of urotoxic metabolites (e.g. acrolein) of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide. It is used as a mucolytic in the management of some respiratory tract conditions e.g. cystic fibrosis where other mucolytics have failed. It acts by reducing the viscosity of pulmonary secretions; the drug's free sulfhydryl group is thought to reduce disulfide linkages of mucoproteins.

    If you have a blood disorder (granulocytopenia)
    If you have a congenital deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6 -phosphate dehydrogenase
    During pregnancy and lactation
    In children under 18 years


Side effects: Allergic reactions that may occur are usually skin reactions: rash, redness, itching, swelling, gradually swelling of the face and tongue, and a lot more dangerous anaphylactic shock which has the following symptoms: itching, cold sweat, dizziness, lethargy, nausea, redness or paleness of skin and shortness of breath.

Metamizole can cause damage to the bone marrow (granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia). Cases of agranulocytosis are rare, but they are still very serious. Symptoms of agranulocytosis include: high fever, chills, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, inflammation of the mouth, nose, throat.

Metamizole can cause digestive disorders such as nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, irritation of the digestive system. You can contact drowsiness, fatigue, weakness, headache, and hypotension, and wheezing.

Precaution:     Allergic reactions to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    asthma or chronic inflammation of the airways
    Anaemia
    The weakness of the kidney or liver
    An ulcer in the stomach or duodenum
    Heart disease and systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg and unstable circulation disorder (initial shock or heart attack)


Mode of action: It inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins D and E resulting in analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects. It also has the potential for causing agranulocytosis.

	Indication: Polycystic ovarian syndrome, Type 2 DM

Dose: The usual starting dose is 500 mg twice daily or 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increase should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks up to a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. 

Patients can be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For these patients requiring additional glycaemic control, metformin may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. 

Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated when given three times a day with meals. The usual starting dose of Metformin HCl extended - release tablet is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal. Dosage increase may be made up to a max. of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal.

Polycystic ovary syndrome Initial: 500 mg/day in the morning for 1 wk, then 500 mg twice daily for 1 wk, then 1.5-1.7 g/day in 2-3 divided doses.

Contra-indication: Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis with or without coma (including diabetic ketoacidosis). Renal failure, severe renal or hepatic impairment, acute conditions which may affect renal function e.g. dehydration, severe infection or shock. Cardiac failure, CHF, IDDM, severe impairment of thyroid function; acute or chronic alcoholism. Acute or chronic diseases which may cause tissue hypoxia e.g. cardiac or respiratory failure, recent MI or shock. Pregnancy, lactation. 	Adult: PO Type 2 DMInitial: 500 mg 2-3 times/day, may increase slowly. Max:2.25 g/day. Polycystic ovary syndrome Initial: 500 mg/day in the morning for 1 wk, then 500 mg twice daily for 1 wk, then 1.5-1.7 g

Side effects: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, wt loss, flatulence, occasional metallic taste; weakness; hypoglycaemia; rash, malabsorption of vit B12. Chest discomfort, flushing, palpitation, chills, headache, lightheadedness, indigestion, abdominal discomfort. Potentially Fatal: Lactic acidosis in presence of renal failure and alcoholism. Patients may experience a metallic taste and there may be weight loss, which in some diabetics could be an advantage.

Precaution: Caution when used in patients with CHF especially in those with unstable or acute heart failure. Risk of lactic acid accumulation increases with the degree of renal impairment. May need to discontinue treatment in patients with stress-related states e.g. fever, trauma, infection or surgery. Metformin should be temporarily discontinued for 48 hr in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular admin of iodinated contrast materials. Elderly. Monitor renal function regularly. Because of possibility of hypoglycemia in combination therapy with a sulphonylurea or insulin, diabetic control should be monitored by blood sugar readings.

Mode of action: Metformin is a biguanide w/ antihyperglycaemic effects, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It decreases hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis; delays intestinal absorption of glucose; and enhances insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Additive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations. May increase serum level w/ cimetidine.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ iodinated contrast agents may increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis.ACI	Politor 500 TAB dr   30's pack 270.90 BDT

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: Dosage of this preparation must be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Pioglitazone 45 mg and Metformin 2550 mg.  

It may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.

The initial and maintenance dose of  it should be carefully selected in patients with advanced age due to the potential for decreased renal function in these populations. 

Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of Metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly.  It should not be initiated if the patients exhibit clinical evidence of active liver disease. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended in all patients prior to initiation of therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin and periodically thereafter. 

Contra-indication: 1. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g. as suggested by serum creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dl in male, >1.4 mg/dl in females or abnormal creatinine clearance), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction and septicemia.
2. Known hypersensitivity to Pioglitazone, Metformin or any other component of this combination.
3. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without coma.

Side effects: Generally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity.

Precaution: Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of insulin. Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases.

Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive this combination.

Mode of action: Pioglitazone is as a potent and highly selective agonist for the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma. Activation of these receptors promotes the production of gene products involved in lipid and glucose metabolism. It also improves insulin response to target cells witho increasing the pancreatic secretion of insulin. Metformin decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity (increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation).

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: The dosage  should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 8mg/2000 mg (Rosiglitazone/Metformin).

 In Drug-Naive Patients: The recommended starting dose of  is 2 mg/500 mg once or twice daily. 

For patients with HbA1c >11% or FPG>270 mg/dL, a starting dose of 2 mg/500 mg twice daily may be considered. The dose may be increased by increment of 2 mg/500 mg per day to a maximum of 8 mg/2,000 mg per day in divided doses if patients are not adequately controlled after 4 weeks.

For patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy, the usual starting dose  is 4 mg Rosiglitazone (daily dose) plus the dose of Metformin already being taken.

For patients inadequately controlled on Rosiglitazone monotherapy, the usual starting dose is 1000 mg Metformin (daily dose) plus the dose of Rosiglitazone already being taken.

When switching from combination therapy of Rosiglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets, the usual starting dose  is the dose of Rosiglitazone and Metformin already being taken. If additional glycemic control is needed, the daily dose may be increased by increment of 4 mg Rosiglitazone and/or 500 mg Metformin, up to the maximum recommended total daily dose of 8 mg/2000 mg.

Contra-indication: It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by serum creatinine levels .1.5 mg/dl (males), 1.4 mg/dl (females), or abnormal creatinine clearance), acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma & known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone maleate or metformin HCl.

Side effects: Rosiglitazone: The commonly reported adverse events are upper respiratory tract infections, injury, headache, back pain, fatigue, sinusitis, diarrhoea and hypoglycemia. There were a small number of patients who had anemia and edema. All these events were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment with Rosiglitazone.
Metformin: Some patients may develop asymptomatic subnormal levels of serum vitamin B12.
Incidence of lactic acidosis is also very rare. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, flatulence and anorexia are common reactions to Metformin.

Precaution: Rosiglitazone: should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. This should be used with caution in patients with edema. Dose-related weight gain was seen with rosiglitazone alone and rosiglitazone together with other hypoglycemic agents.

Metformin: Monitoring of renal function: Patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal should not receive this tablet. In patients with advanced age, the dose should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. 

Mode of action: Rosiglitazone: Lowers glucose by improving target cell response to insulin without increasing pancreatic cell secretion; activates nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, which influences the production of gene products involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.

Metformin: Biguanide; acts by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization; improves glucose tolerance and lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: Dose of this combination should be individualized on the basis of the patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg Sitagliptin and 2000 mg Metformin.

Sitagliptin/Metformin combination should generally be given twice daily with meals, with gradual dose escalation, to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to Metformin. 

The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with Metformin is 50 mg Sitagliptin/500 mg Metformin hydrochloride twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin.

The starting dose in patients already treated with Metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of Metformin already being taken. 

For patients taking Metformin 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of this combination is 50 mg Sitagliptin/1000 mg Metformin hydrochloride twice daily. May adjust the dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg Sitagliptin and 2000 mg Metformin extended release. Administer once daily with a meal preferably in the evening. Gradually escalate the dose to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to Metformin. 

Maintain the same total daily dose of Sitagliptin and Metformin when changing between Sitagliptin + Metformin ER, without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 2000 mg Metformin extended release.


Contra-indication: • Renal dysfunction, e.g., serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL [males], >1.4 mg/dL [females] or abnormal creatinine clearance.• Metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis.• History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Sitagliptin + Metformin or to one of its components. 

Side effects: Headache, diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis. Angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis, hypoglycaemia.

Precaution: Do not use the combination of Sitagliptin & Metformin in patients with hepatic disease. Before initiating the combination and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function and verify as normal. May need to discontinue the combination and temporarily use insulin during periods of stress and decreased intake of fluids and food as may occur with fever, trauma, infection or surgery.

Mode of action: Sitagliptin: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, thereby increasing and prolonging incretin hormone activity which are inactivated by DPP-4 enzyme. Incretins increase insulin release and synthesis from pancreatic beta cells and reduce glucagon secretion pancreatic alpha cells.

Metformin: Biguanide; acts by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization; improves glucose tolerance and lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: Adults: Based on the patient's current dose of Metformin, Combination of Vildagliptin & Metformin may be initiated at either 50 mg/500 mg or 50 mg/850 mg twice daily, 1 tab in the morning and the other in the evening. 

The recommended daily dose is 100 mg Vildagliptin plus 2000 mg Metformin HCl. Patients receiving Vildagliptin and Metformin from separate tablets may be switched to Combination of Vildagliptin & Metformin containing the same doses of each component. Doses higher than 100 mg of Vildagliptin are not recommended. There is no clinical experience of Vildagliptin and Metformin in triple combination with other antidiabetic agents. 

Taking Combination of Vildagliptin & Metformin with or just after food may reduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Metformin.


Contra-indication: This combination is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Vildagliptin or Metformin Hydrochloride or to any of the excipients. It is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, and septicaemia. It is also contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure patients and in patients with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. It should be temporarily discontinued in patients undergoing radiologic studies involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials, because use of such products may result in acute alteration of renal function.

Side effects: Hypoglycaemia, delayed gastric emptying, nausea and vomiting. Flu-like symptoms, headache and dizziness may occur.
Potentially Fatal: Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Precaution: Lactic acidosis can occur due to Metformin accumulation. If metabolic acidosis is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be hospitalized immediately. 

Patients with renal impairment:
This combination should not be used in patients with renal failure or renal dysfunction, e.g. serum creatinine levels > 1.5 mg/dL (>135 micro mol/L) in males and > 1.4 mg/dL (>110 micro mol/L) in females.

Patients with hepatic impairment:
This combination is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment including patients with a pre-treatment ALT or AST >3 X the upper limit of normal. 

Mode of action: Metformin: Biguanide; acts by decreasing endogenous hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization; improves glucose tolerance and lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .

Vildagliptin is a dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that improves glycaemic control by preventing DPP-4 from inactivating the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, thus prolonging incretin activity in response to ingestion of nutrients. This increases insulin sensitivity, decreases glucagon secretion and improves ?-cell function.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

	Indication: Psoriasis, Vitiligo, Eczema, T-Cell Lymphoma

Dose: For topical solution dosage form:

For vitiligo:  Adults and children 12 years of age and over—Apply to the affected area of the skin and allow to dry for one to two minutes, then apply again within two to two and one-half hours before UVA exposure.

Methoxsalen lotion is applied only in small well-defined lesions and preferably on lesions that can be protected by clothing or sunscreen from later exposure to UVA.

Do not sunbathe for 24 hours before taking methoxsalen and having the UVA light treatment.Take this medication by mouth with food or milk, usually 2 to 4 hours before your UVA light treatment or as directed by your doctor. 

The dosage of methoxsalen is based on  weight, medical condition, and response to treatment. The amount and time of UVA light for each treatment is based on  skin type and response to treatment. patient may have UVA light treatments 2 to 4 times a week when first start and then less frequently as  condition improves.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Nausea or trouble sleeping may occur with methoxsalen. Mild itching/drying/reddening/darkening of skin may occur when methoxsalen is used along with UVA light treatment.

Unlikely but serious side effects occur: severe reddening of skin, blistering/peeling/burning of skin, thinning/wrinkling skin, painful browning/whitening/yellowing of nails, swelling ankles, mental/mood changes (such as depression, nervousness).

Precaution: For the treatment of psoriasis, this medication should only be used for severe psoriasis that has not responded well to other treatments since this medication may cause serious side effects (such as cataracts, skin cancer/aging).

Patients must not sunbathe during the 24 hours prior to methoxsalen ingestion and UV exposure. The presence of a sunburn may prevent an accurate evaluation of the patient's response to photochemotherapy.

Mode of action: Methoxsalen increases skin reactivity to long-wavelength UV rays. It bonds covalently to DNA inhibiting DNA synthesis and cell division, which can lead to cell injury. This effect is used in photochemotherapy or PUVA [psoralen (P) and high-intensity long-wavelength UVA irradiation].

	Indication: Anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease

Dose: Anemia Associated with Chronic Renal Failure

Do not increase dose more frequently than q4weeks; decreases in dose can occur more frequently; avoid frequent dose adjustments

If hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., > 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce dose by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses

For patients who do not respond adequately, if hemoglobin has not increased by >1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase dose by 25%

For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing Mircera dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks; use lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce need for RBC transfusions; evaluate other causes of anemia; discontinue Mircera if responsiveness does not improve

Patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis

    Initiate Mircera treatment when hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL
    If hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt dose of Mircera
    Dose if not currently on ESA therapy: 0.6 mcg/kg IV/SC q2week initially 
    Once hemoglobin has been stabilized, dose may be administered once monthly using a dose that is twice that of every-two-week dose and subsequently titrated as necessary

Patients with chronic renal failure not on dialysis

    Consider initiating treatment only when hemoglobin level is < 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply. Rate of hemoglobin decline indicates likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and reducing risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal

    If hemoglobin level >10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt dose, and use lowest dose sufficient to reduce need for RBC transfusions
    Dose if not currently on ESA therapy: 0.6 mcg/kg IV/SC q2week initially 
    Once hemoglobin has been stabilized, Mircera may be administered once monthly using a dose that is twice that of the every-two-week dose and subsequently titrated as necessary

Switching Patients Currently on Other ESA

    Receiving epoetin <8000 units/week or darbepoetin <40 mcg/week: 120 mcg/qmonth or 60 mcg/q2week IV/SC

The following systemic side effects may rarely occurs with the use of Methyldopa - angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, orthostatic hypotension, edema or weight gain, bradycardia, pancreatitis, colitis, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, constipation, dryness of mouth, hyperprolactinemia, bone marrow depression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia; rheumatoid factor, hepatitis, jaundice, myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis, eosinophilia, parkinsonism, bell's palsy, nightmares and reversible mild psychoses or depression, dizziness, lightheadedness, paresthesias, arthralgia, myalgia, nasal stuffiness, rash, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, lactation, impotence. However, significant adverse effects due to Methyldopa have been infrequent and this agent usually is well tolerated.

Precaution: Methyldopa should be used with caution in patients with a history of previous liver disease or dysfunction.
Some patients taking Methyldopa experience clinical edema or weight gain, which may be controlled by use of a diuretic. Methyldopa should not be continued if edema progresses or signs of heart failure appear.
Hypertension has recurred occasionally after dialysis in patients given Methyldopa because the drug is removed by this procedure.
Rarely involuntary choreoathetotic movements have been observed during therapy with Methyldopa in patients with severe bilateral cerebrovascular disease. If these movements occur, stop therapy

Mode of action: Methyldopa stimulates alpha 2-adrenoceptors which results in reduced sympathetic tone and fall in BP.

	Indication: Cardiac arrest, Multiple sclerosis, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Acute bronchitis, Vestibular neuritis

Dose: The initial dosage of parenterally administered Methyl Prednisolone Acetate will vary from 4 to 120 mg, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.

It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

A. Administration for Local Effect

1. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis. The dose for intra-articular administration depends upon the size of the joint and varies with the severity of the condition in the individual patient. In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection. The doses in the following table are given as a general guide:

Large Joint: Knees, Ankles & Shoulders:	20 to 80 mg
Medium joint: Elbows & Wrists:	 10 to 40 mg
Small joint:  Metacarpophalangeal, Interphalangeal, Sternoclavicular & Acromioclavicular:  4 to 10 mg

2. The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 to 30 mg. In recurrent or chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.

3. Injections for Local Effect in Dermatologic Conditions. Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 to 60 mg of the suspension is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. 

B. Administration for Systemic Effect

The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of methylprednisolone tablets is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. The recommended dosage may be reduced for pediatric patients, but dosage should be governed by the severity of the condition rather than by strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.

Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks. Similarly, in patients with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks.

If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.


Contra-indication: Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents.

Intramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route.

Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions

Precaution: General

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual.

Since complications of treatment with glucocorticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

Karposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

Mode of action: Methylprednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity and minimal mineralocorticoid properties. It decreases inflammation by suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability.

Dose: This preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation.

When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours.

In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.

In other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.

It should be emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. 
If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

To prepare solutions for intravenous infusion, first prepare the solution for injection as directed. This solution may then be added to indicate amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.


Contra-indication: Powder is also contraindicated in systemic fungal infections and patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents. Intramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Methylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route. Methylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions

Side effects: The following adverse reactions have been reported with methylprednisolone acetate or other corticosteroids: Allergic Reactions Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema.

Precaution: General The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with glucocorticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Karposis sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement.

Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency;  hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis.

Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed.

Mode of action: Methylprednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid with mainly glucocorticoid activity and minimal mineralocorticoid properties. It decreases inflammation by suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Decreases effect of anticholinesterases in myasthenia gravis. May decrease the hypoglycaemic effects of antidiabetic agents. Decreases serum concentrations of salicylates. Increased hypokalemic effects of potassium-depleting diuretics (thiazides or furosemide), amphotericin B, bronchodilator therapy with xanthines or ?2 agonists. Increase incidence of GI bleeding and ulceration with NSAIDs. May increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. Decreased levels/effects with CYP3A4 inducers (aminoglutethimide, carbamazepine, nafcillin, nevirapine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifamycins). Increased levels/effects with CYP3A4 inhibitors (azole antifungals, clarithromycin, diclofenac, doxycycline, erythromycin, imatinib, isoniazid, nefazodone, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine, telithromycin, and verapamil). May decrease the effects of vaccines (dead organism) or increase the risk of vaccinal infection (live organism). Antacids and bile sequestrants may decrease the absorption of corticosteroids, separate admin by 2 hr. Increased risk of myopathy with neuromuscular-blocking agents, tendinopathies with fluoroquinolones.Acme Ltd.	Nutramid Drops 1mg/ml 15ml bot 9.64 BDT

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.

Side effects: Skin rash and urticaria may occur rarely.

Precaution: Caution should be taken in case of renal impaired patients.

Mode of action: Metronidazole is converted to reduction products that interact w/ DNA to cause destruction of helical DNA structure and strand leading to a protein synthesis inhibition and cell death in susceptible organisms. It is active against most anaerobic protozoa, some gm+ve, gm-ve and facultative anaerobes.

Nystatin, a polyene antifungal, binds to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This binding affects the cell wall permeability allowing leakage of cellular contents.

Polymyxin B disrupts the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane of mostly gm-ve organisms allowing leakage of intracellular constituents by binding to membrane phospholipids.

Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It binds to 30S ribosomal subunits of bacterial ribosome thus inhibiting protein synthesis and generating errors in genetic code transcription causing cell death. It acts against many gram-negative aerobes and some gram-positive aerobes. It lacks activity against fungi, viruses and most anaerobic bacteria.

Dose: Oral dosage: For adults 7.5-15 mg daily. In elderly and debilitated patients, the recommended dose is 7.5 mg. In premedication, 15 mg of Midazolam should be given 30-60 minutes before the procedure.

Intravenous administration:
Endoscopic or Cardiovascular Procedures
In healthy adults the initial dose is approximately 2.5 mg. In cases of severe illness and in elderly patients, the initial dose must be reduced to 1 to 1.5 mg.

Induction of Anesthesia
The dose is 10-15 mg I. V.

Intramuscular administration:
Adult: 0.07-0.1 mg/kg bodyweight i. m. Usual dose is about 5 mg.
Children: 0.15-0.20 mg/kg.
Elderly and debilitated patients: 0.025-0.05 mg/kg

Rectal administration in children:
For preoperative sedation, rectal administration of the ampoule solution (0.35-0.45 mg/kg) 20-30 min before induction of general anesthesia. 

Contra-indication: Midazolam must not be given to patients with severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea syndrome and with known hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines or to any component of the product.

Side effects: At the start of therapy, drowsiness during daytime, confusion, fatigue, headache and muscle weakness may occur which usually disappear with repeated administration. Following parenteral (IV or IM) administration of Midazolam, fluctuations in vital signs have been noted including respiratory depression, apnoea, variations in blood pressure and pulse rate.

Precaution: Midazolam IV should be administered very slowly.

Mode of action: Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine. It exerts sedative and hypnotic, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant actions. While the probable anxiolytic action might be as a result of the drug's ability to increase glycine inhibitory neurotransmitter level, the hypnotic/anaesthetic action may be due to the occupation of the benzodiazepine and GABA receptors leading to membrane hyperpolarisation and neuronal inhibition, and further interfering with the re-uptake of GABA at the synapses.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Increased CNS depression with alcohol, opioids, barbiturates, other sedatives and anaesthetics. Increased respiratory depression with opiates, phenobarbital, other benzodiazepines. Plasma concentrations increased by CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole and itraconazole, antiretroviral agents, quinupristin with dalfopristin. Midazolam concentration decreased by phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampicin. Halothane, thiopental requirements may be reduced during concurrent use.Incepta	Mifeston TAB dr 200mg 3's pack 525 BDT
	
Renata	MIF TAB dr 200mg 3's pack 525 BDT
	Indication: Termination of pregnancy, Labour induction, Cervical softening and dilatation,  Postcoital contraception.

Dose: 1. As a medical alternative to surgical termination of intra-uterine pregnancy in early pregnancy: 600 mg Mifepristone (3 tablets) in a single oral dose followed 36-48 hrs later, by the administration of a prostaglandin analogue Misoprostol 400 mcg orally (up to 49 days).  

2. Softening and dilatation of the cervix uteri prior to surgical pregnancy termination: 200 mg Mifepristone (one tablet), followed 36-48 hrs later (but not beyond) by a surgical termination of pregnancy. 

3. Preparation for the action of prostaglandin analogues in the termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (to reduce the doses of prostaglandin): 600 mg of Mifepristone (3 tablets) taken in a single oral dose, 36-48 hrs prior to scheduled prostaglandin administration which will be repeated as often as indicated. 

4. Labour induction for expulsion of a dead fetus (fetal death in utero): 600 mg of Mifepristone in a single oral daily dose for 2 consecutive days. Mifepristone alone leads to expulsion in about 60%. Labour should be induced by the usual methods if it has not started within 72 hrs following the first administration of Mifepristone. 

5. Postcoital contraception 600 mg as a single dose w/in 72 hr of unprotected intercourse.


Contra-indication: Confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, chronic adrenal failure, concurrent long-term corticosteroid therapy, history of allergy to mifepristone, misoprostol or other prostaglandin, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, porphyria, hepatic or renal impairment; pregnancy and lactation; IUD in place; undiagnosed adnexal mass.

Side effects: Excessive vaginal bleeding; UTI; uterine haemorrhage; uterine infections; unusual tiredness or weakness; back pain; diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting; fever; dizziness; headache; anxiety; GI cramps.

Precaution: Mifepristone must not be administered if there is doubt as to the existence or age of the pregnancy or if an extra-uterine pregnancy is suspected. An ultrasound scan and/or measurement of Beta-hCG must be performed before administration. For first trimester abortions, Mifepristone is contraindicated if the pregnancy is beyond 49 days of amenorrhoea when used with Misoprostol.  Mifepristone should never be prescribed in patients with chronic adrenal failure, known allergy to Mifepristone or to any component of the product, severe asthma uncontrolled by corticosteroid therapy, porphyrias and renal failure, liver failure or malnutrition, or during breast feeding. Mifepristone is a lipophilic compound and may theoretically be excreted in the mother's breast milk, however no data is available.

Mode of action: Mifepristone is a progesterone antagonist with antiglucocorticoid activity. It binds to the intracellular progesterone receptor where it competitively inhibits progesterone attachment. It is also a partial progesterone agonist.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Decreased efficacy with aspirin and NSAIDs. Efficacy of corticosteroids (including inhaled) decreased, monitor patients during co-admin and for several days afterwards.Sharif	MTP kit TAB dr  2 strips (1+4 tabs) pack 300 BDT

Side effects: Nasal/Oral inhalation: Headache, fatigue, depression; musculoskeletal pain, arthalgia; sinusitis, rhinitis, upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, cough, epistaxis; viral infection, nasal and oral candidiasis; chest pain; abdominal pain, dry throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gastroenteritis, nausea, vomiting; dysmenorrhoea; back pain, myalgia; conjunctivitis; earache, otitis media; asthma, bronchitis, dysphonia; nasal irritation, burning and septal perforation; wheezing; nasal ulcers; growth suppression. 

Precaution: Use with caution in active or inactive tuberculosis infection, herpes simplex virus infection of the eye, untreated infections affecting the body as a whole etc.

Mode of action: Mometasone depresses the formation, release and activity of endogenous inflammatory chemical mediators (e.g. kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes and prostaglandin). It inhibits the margination and subsequent cell migration to the injury site, reverses vascular dilatation and permeability, resulting in decreased access of cells to the area of injury.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased risk of hypokalaemia with amphotericin B, potassium-wasting diuretics. Decreases hypoglycaemic effects of antidiabetic drugs. Increased serum levels with antifungals (imidazole). Increased risk of tendinopathies with fluoroquinolones.ACI	Meloderm Cream  .1% 5g 100.30 BDT

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:Indication: Cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy, Foods and water treatment

Dose: The recommended dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing for adult patients is 32 tablets (48 grams of sodium phosphate) taken orally with a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids in the following manner: 

The evening before the colonoscopy procedure: Take 4 monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets with 8 ounces of clear liquids every 15 minutes for a total of 20 tablets.                     

On the day of the colonoscopy procedure: Starting 3-5 hours before the procedure, take 4 monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets with 8 ounces of clear liquids every 15 minutes for a total of 12 tablets. 

Patients should be advised of the importance of taking the recommended fluid regimen. It is recommended that patients receiving monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets be advised to adequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets.  

Patients should not use monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets for colon cleansing within seven days of previous administration. No additional enema or laxative is required, and patients should be advised NOT to take additional agents, particularly those containing sodium phosphate

Contra-indication: Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with biopsy-proven acute phosphate nephropathy.

Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to sodium phosphate salts or any of its ingredients.

Side effects: Abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most common adverse events reported with the use of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Dizziness and headache were reported less frequently. Since diarrhea was considered as a part of the efficacy of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, diarrhea was not defined as an adverse event in the clinical studies. Table 2 shows the most common adverse events associated with the use of 48 grams of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, 60 grams of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets, and 60 grams of Visicol in the colon preparation trials (n=931).

Precaution: Patients should be instructed to drink 8 ounces of clear liquids with each 4-tablet dose of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Patients should take a total of 2 quarts of clear liquids with monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets. Inadequate fluid intake, as with any effective purgative, may lead to excessive fluid loss, hypovolemia, and dehydration. Dehydration from purgation may be exacerbated by inadequate oral fluid intake, vomiting, and/or use of diuretics.

Patients should be instructed not to administer additional laxative or purgative agents, particularly additional sodium phosphate-based purgative or enema products.

Prolongation of the QT interval has been observed in some patients who were dosed with sodium phosphate colon preparations. QT prolongation with sodium phosphate tablets has been associated with electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval, since serious complications may occur. Pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients with known prolonged QT.

Administration of monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets may induce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, since this endoscopic finding was observed with other sodium phosphate cathartic preparations. In the monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets clinical program, aphthous ulcers were observed in 3% of patients who took the 48 gram monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets dosing regimen. This colonoscopic finding should be considered in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease.

Because published data suggest that sodium phosphate absorption may be enhanced in patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate tablets should be used with caution in such patients.

Mode of action: Morphine is a phenanthrene derivative which acts mainly on the CNS and smooth muscles. It binds to opiate receptors in the CNS altering pain perception and response. Analgesia, euphoria and dependence are thought to be due to its action at the mu-1 receptors while resp depression and inhibition of intestinal movements are due to action at the mu-2 receptors. Spinal analgesia is mediated by morphine agonist action at the K receptor.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Additive depressant effects w/ other CNS depressants (e.g. sedatives, hypnotics, general anaesth, phenothiazines, other tranquilisers). May enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants. Reduced analgesic effect w/ mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesics (e.g. pentazocine, nalbuphine, buprenorphine). Increased plasma concentrations w/ cimetidine. May reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. May delay the absorption of mexiletine. May antagonise the GI effect of cisapride, domperidone and metoclopramide. May produce hyperpyrexia and CNS toxicity w/ dopaminergics.
Potentially Fatal: MAOIs intensify the effect of morphine resulting to severe and even fatal events (e.g. anxiety, confusion, resp depression, sometimes leading to coma).ACI	Maxiflox TAB dr 400mg 10's pack 500 BDT

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Absorption reduced by sucralfate, and divalent and trivalent cations e.g. aluminium, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc. Excretion reduced and plasma concentrations increased with probenecid. Reduced effects with chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline.
Potentially Fatal: Fatal haemorrhagic enterocolitis may occur when used with high-dose melphalan in children. Increased risk of nephrotoxicity with ciclosporin. May increase effects of oral anticoagulants e.g. warfarin.Indication: Opioid dependence, Opioid overdosage, Opioid-induced depression

Dose: Adult: As hydrochloride: 200 mg to 3 g daily.
Intravenous
Opioid overdosage
Adult: As hydrochloride: 0.4-2 mg repeated if necessary at 2-3 min intervals. If there is no response after a total of 10 mg has been given, consider the possibility of overdosage with other drugs. Reduce dose for opioid-dependent patients: 0.1-0.2 mg. IM/SC routes may be used (at IV doses) if IV admin is not feasible. 
Child: As hydrochloride: Initially 10 mcg/kg IV followed by 100 mcg/kg IV if necessary. Alternatively, 0.4-0.8 mg IM or SC, repeated as necessary, if IV admin is not feasible.
Parenteral
Opioid-induced depression in neonates due to obstetric analgesia
Child: As hydrochloride: 10 mcg/kg IV, IM or SC repeated at 2-3 min intervals if necessary or 60 mcg/kg as a single IM dose.
Intravenous
Reversal of central depression from opioid use during surgery
Adult: As hydrochloride: 100-200 mcg at intervals of 2-3 minute, titrate dose according to response while maintaining analgesia.
Child: As hydrochloride: 5-10 mcg IV at 2-3 min intervals.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Occur secondarily to reversal (withdrawal) of narcotic analgesia and sedation. Mental depression, apathy, inability to concentrate, sleepiness, irritability, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting in high oral doses during initial treatment of opiate addiction.
Potentially Fatal: Severe cardiopulmonary effects (e.g. hypotension, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, cardiac arrest) in postoperative patients, most frequently in those with preexisting CV disease. Recurrence of respiratory depression in long-acting opioids.

Precaution: Patients physically dependent on opioids, or who have received large doses of opioids (acute withdrawal syndrome may be precipitated). Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist that acts competitively at opioid receptors.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Decreased effect of opioid analgesics.
Potentially Fatal: Acute withdrawal reaction in physically dependent patients may occur with opioid analgesics. Severe cardiopulmonary effects may occur with cardiotoxic drugs.Navana	Naltrax TAB dr 50mg 10's pack 1405.30 BDT
	
Navana	NalTax TAB dr 50mg 10's pack 650 BDT
	Indication: Opioid dependence, Alcohol dependence

Dose: Adult: PO Opioid dependence Initial: 25 mg, then up to 50 mg/day if no withdrawal signs. Maintenance: 350 mg/wk given as 50 mg/day or divided in 3 doses (given on 3 days of the wk) for improved compliance. 

Adjunct in alcohol dependence 50 mg/day. 

Contra-indication: Patients concurrently dependent on opioids; acute hepatitis or hepatic failure; acute opioid withdrawal; patients on therapeutic opioid analgesics.

Side effects: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting; anxiety, insomnia, lethargy, headache, musculoskeletal pain; anorexia, diarrhoea, constipation; increased thirst; chest pain; chills, dizziness; sexual dysfunction; rash, liver function abnormalities and reversible idiopathic thrombocytopenia. Inj-site reactions.

Precaution: Hepatic or renal impairment. Monitor LFTs regularly. Patients should be opioid-free for at least 7-10 days prior to initiating naltrexone therapy. Strictly warn patients against the use of opioids while on naltrexone. Monitor for inj-site reactions. Pregnancy, lactation. History of bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia).

Mode of action: Naltrexone acts as a competitive antagonist at opioid receptor sites. It blocks the action of opioids and precipitates withdrawal symptoms in opioid-dependent individuals.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: May reduce effects of opiate-containing preparations e.g. those used for cough and cold, diarrhoea and pain. Increased or decreased serum levels with drugs that alter hepatic metabolism. Potentially increased hepatotoxic effects with disulfiram. Increased risk of naltrexone-induced lethargy and somnolence with thioridazine. May increase insulin requirements.Chemist Ltd.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity. Aspirin or NSAID allergy. Perioperative pain in the setting of CABG surgery. Pregnancy (3rd trimester).

Side effects: Oedema, palpitation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, light headedness, vertigo, pruritus, skin eruption, ecchymosis, purpura, rash, fluid retention, abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, heartburn, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, stomatitis, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, indigestion, ulcers, vomiting, abnormal renal function, haemolysis, anaemia, increased bleeding time, elevated LFTs, visual disturbances, tinnitus, hearing disturbances, dyspnoea, diaphoresis, thirst.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions. Exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

Precaution: Pre-existing CV risk factors or disease e.g. fluid retention, CHF, hypertension. History of GI disease (bleeding or ulcers). Other forms of asthma. Hepatic impairment; closely monitor patients with any abnormal LFT. Renal impairment. Elderly. Lactation.

Mode of action: Naproxen, a propionic acid derivative, is a prototypical NSAID. It reversibly inhibits the cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and -2) enzymes, thus resulting in reduced synthesis of prostaglandin precursors. It can inhibit platelet aggregation, has anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic actions.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: May enhance methotrexate toxicity. Reduced BP response to ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Increased risk of serious GI events (e.g. ulcer) w/ aspirin. Increased risk of GI bleeding w/ warfarin. May reduce the natriuretic effects of furosemide or thiazide diuretics. May increase serum lithium concentrations and reduce renal lithium clearance. 

Delayed absorption w/ antacids, colestyramine or sucralfate. May interfere w/ the antihypertensive effects of ?-blockers (e.g. propranolol). May increase serum levels w/ probenecid.ACI	Anaflex Gel   15gm tube/ 30gm tube 62.23 / 116. BDT

	Indication: Conjunctivitis, Keratitis, Blepharitis

Dose: For fungal keratitis: The preferred initial dosage is 1 drop instilled in the conjuntival sac (s) at 1-2 hours interval. The frequency of application can usually be reduced to 1 drop 6-8 times daily after the first 3-4 days. 

Therapy should generally be continued for 14 to 21 days or until there is resolution of active fungal keratitis. In many cases, it may be helpful to reduce the dosage gradually at 4 to 7 days intervals to assure the replicating fungus has been eliminated. 

For fungal blepharitis & conjunctivitis: Less frequent initial dosage, 1 drop 4-6 times daily may be sufficient. 

Contra-indication: Natamycin sterile ophthalmic suspension is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to any of its components.


Side effects: Local irritation, conjunctival chemosis, hyperemia, etc.


Precaution: For topical eye use only. Failure of improvement of keratitis following 7-10 days of administration of the drug suggests that the infection may be caused by a microorganism not susceptible to natamycin. 

Mode of action: Natamycin is a polyene antifungal antibiotic which acts by increasing cell membrane permeability in susceptible fungi. It is active against a variety of yeast and filamentous fungi.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction:Renata	Deltasone N Eye/Ear Drops   5  ml drop 39.98 BDT
	Indication: Bacterial ocular infection, otitis externa

Dose:  Instill 1 or 2 drops every 3 or 4 hours, or more frequently as required. Acute infections may require administration every 30 minutes, with frequency of administration reduced as the infection is brought under control. 



Contra-indication: Epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of the ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication. (Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components.)

The use of these combinations is always contraindicated after uncomplicated removal of a corneal foreign body.

Side effects: Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available since no denominator of treated patients is available.

Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredients are allergic sensitizations including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . More serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. The reactions due to the steroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.

Although systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical steroids.

Corticosteroid-containing preparations have also been reported to cause perforation of the globe. Keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and conjunctival hyperemia have occasionally been reported following local use of steroids.

Secondary infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used.

Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.

Precaution: The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 20 milliliters should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.

The possibility of persistent fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged steroid dosing.

As with other antimicrobial preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated.

 . If purulent discharge, inflammation, or pain becomes aggravated, the patient should discontinue use of the medicatioin and consult a physician.

Allergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.

Mode of action: Neomycin, an aminoglyoside with antimicrobial spectrum similar to gentamicin, binds to the 30S subunits of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and thereby disrupting DNA synthesis. It is active against many gram-negative aerobes and against some strains of staphylococci. 

Prednisolone decreases inflammation by inhibition of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability. It suppresses the immune system by reducing the activity and production of the lymphocytes and eosinophils.

Contra-indication: Niacin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Niacin or any component of this medication, significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction, active peptic ulcer disease or arterial bleeding.

Side effects: Niacin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions have been mild and transient.The most frequent advers effects were flushing, itching, pruritis, nausea and GI upset, jaundice ,hypotension, tachycardia, increased serum blood glucose and uric acid levels, myalgia.

Precaution: Before instituting therapy with Niacin, an attempt should be made to control hyperlipidemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients and to treat other underlying medical problems. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during Niacin therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in glucose intolerance, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary.

Caution should also be used when Niacin is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers or adrenergic blocking agents. Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with Niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count and increases in prothrombin time. Caution should be observed when Niacin is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time and platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). So phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk.

Mode of action: Nicotinic acid is a derivative of vitamin B3 and is incorporated into coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are involved in multiple cellular metabolic pathways. Nicotinic acid also reduces total serum cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, and triglycerides, and increases HDL cholesterol. It appears to decrease hepatic synthesis of VLDL, however, the exact mechanisms of nicotinic acid's antilipemic effects are unknown and are unrelated to its role as a vitamin.

Mode of action: Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and analgesic properties. It inhibits prostaglandin synthetase/cyclooxygenase, which limits prostaglandin production. Its cyclooxygenase inhibiting potency is intermediate, but is relatively selective for the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) thus the potential for gastric injury and intolerance is less. It is also a free radical scavenger, and helps protect against the tissue damage that occurs during inflammation.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Precaution: 1. General

Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.
2. Physical Examination and Follow-Up

A periodic personal and family medical history and complete physical examination are appropriate for all women, including women using oral contraceptives. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.
3. Lipid Disorders

Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.


4. Liver Function

If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.
5. Fluid Retention

Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.
6. Emotional Disorders

Patients becoming significantly depressed while taking oral contraceptives should stop the medication and use an alternate method of contraception in an attempt to determine whether the symptom is drug-related. Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a significant degree.
7. Contact Lenses

Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.
8. Gastrointestinal

Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption resulting in decreased serum concentrations

Mode of action: Ethinylestradiol (EE): Reduces LHRH release from hypothalamus, reduces gonadotropin release from pituitary; increase synthesis of DNA, RNA, and various proteins in target tissues.

Norgestrel: Progestin; inhibits gonadotropin secretion from pituitary; prevents follicular maturation and ovulation, stimulates growth of mammary tissues.

Norgestrel is a progestogen derived from nortestosterone while ethinylestradiol is a synthetic oestrogen. When used together, they inhibit ovulation, and affect other changes such as changes in the cervical mucus and the endometrium, which makes conception unfavourable.

Mode of action: Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic with affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A/2C, dopamine, muscarinic M1-M5, histamine H1 and adrenergic ?1 receptors.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Olanzapine may antagonise the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Drugs that induce CYP1A2 or glucuronyl transferase enzymes e.g. omeprazole and rifampicin, may increase olanzapine clearance. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 may potentially inhibit olanzapine elimination. Carbamazepine may increase the clearance of olanzapine. Concomitant admin of activated charcoal reduced the oral bioavailability of olanzapine by 50-60%. Caution should be taken when olanzapine is administered with centrally acting drugs and alcohol.ACI	Abetis TAB dr 10mg 30's pack 151.20 BDT

	Indication: Hypertension, Diabetic nephropathy, 

Dose:  	Oral
Hypertension
Adult: Initial: 10-20 mg once daily may then be increased up to max 40 mg once daily if needed.
Child: 6-16 yr <35 kg: 10 mg once daily; >35 kg: 20 mg once daily. Doses may be doubled once if necessary after 2 wk.
Elderly: No dosage adjustment needed.
Hepatic impairment: Moderate: Initial: 10 mg once daily may increase up to max 20 mg once daily.

Contra-indication: Pregnancy (2nd and 3rd trimesters); biliary obstruction.

Side effects: Dizziness, headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, nausea, chest pain, bronchitis, cough, pharyngitis, rhinitis, arthritis, back pain, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, hypotension, peripheral oedema, haematuria, UTI, hyperkalaemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricaemia, elevated liver enzymes, facial edema, angioedema, and rhabdomyolysis.
Potentially Fatal: Acute renal failure.

Precaution: Drugs that act on renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal injury and death when used in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Olmesartan medoxomil should be discontinued as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. May be associated with oliguria, progressive azotaemia, and acute renal failure (rare). Patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis may have increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency. Caution in renal impairment; monitor serum creatinine and potassium levels periodically. Avoid use in severe renal impairment (CrCl< 20 mL/min) and severe hepatic impairment. Caution in patients with aortic or mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with primary aldosteronism may not respond to angiotensin receptor antagonist. Not recommended in lactation.

Mode of action: Olmesartan is a selective and competitive angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist that blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. As a result, olmesartan relaxes blood vessels, hence lowering BP and increases blood supply and oxygen to the heart.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Increased risk of hyperkalaemia w/ ACE inhibitors, K-sparing diuretics, K salts or K supplements and drugs that may increase serum K (e.g. ciclosporin, eplerenone). May potentiate BP lowering effects w/ other antihypertensives. May decrease glomerular filtration w/ NSAIDs which can cause acute renal failure. May increase serum concentrations and toxicity of lithium.ACI	Contova 0.1% Eye Drops  0.1% 5  ml drop 100.68 BDT

	Indication: Severe allergic asthma

Dose: Adult: SC Dose depends on patients wt and pre-treatment serum IgE levels. Dose may range from 75-300 mg 4 wkly to 225-375 mg 2 wkly. Not >150 mg/inj site.

Contra-indication: Previous severe hypersensitivity reaction, acute bronchospasm, status asthmaticus.

Side effects: Headache; upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, pharyngitis; viral infection; pain, fatigue, dizziness; dermatitis, pruritus; arthralgia; earache; inj site reaction.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions including bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, dyspnoea and/or angioedema of the throat or tongue.

Precaution: Children <12 yr; pregnancy; lactation; patients at risk for parasitic infections. Corticosteriod therapy should not be stopped abruptly. Delayed-onset anaphylaxis has been reported; reactions usually occur within 2 hr of admin, but may occur up to 24 hr to >1 yr after initiation of regular treatment. Treatment should only be under direct medical supervision and be observed for a min of 2 hr following admin. May increase risk of malignancy in some patients.

Mode of action: Omalizumab is an IgG monoclonal antibody (recombinant DNA-derived) which inhibits IgE binding to the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells and basophils.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Cytochrome P-450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for drug-drug interactions. No formal drug or vaccine interaction studies have been performed with Omalizumab. There is no pharmacological reason to expect that commonly prescribed medications used in the treatment of asthma will interact with omalizumab.

In clinical studies, Omalizumab was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral corticosteroids, inhaled short- and long-acting beta-agonists, leukotriene modifiers, theophyllines and oral antihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of Omalizumab was altered with these other commonly used asthma medications. Limited data are available on the use of Xolair in combination with specific immunotherapy (hyposensitisation therapy).

Omalizumab may indirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other parasitic infections.
Incompatibilities: Omalizumab should not be mixed with any medication or diluents other than water for injections.Drug International Ltd.	OMG-3 CAP 1gm Omg-3 180 BDT

	Indication: Dyslipidemia, Hypertriglyceridaemin,

Dose: The daily dose is 4 grams per day. The daily dose may be taken as a single 4-gram dose (4 capsules) or as two 2-gram doses (2 capsules given twice daily). 

Contra-indication:  Patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to LOVAZA or any of its components.

Side effects: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Precaution: In patients with hepatic impairment, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels should be monitored periodically during therapy . In some patients, increases in ALT levels without a concurrent increase in AST levels were observed.

Mode of action: Possibly inhibits acyl CoA: 1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increases peroxisomal beta-oxidation in liver; may decrease hepatic triglyceride synthesis; plasma lipoprotein lipase activity may increase.

IV Gastric and duodenal ulcers; Reflux oesophagitis 40 mg once daily. Prophylaxis of acid aspiration during general anesth 40 mg, to be completed 1 hr before the surgery.

Contra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to any of its component.

Side effects: Diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, constipation, vomiting, flatulence, acid regurgitation, taste perversion, arthralgia, myalgia, urticaria, dry mouth, dizziness, headache, paraesthesia, abdominal pain, skin rashes, weakness, back pain, upper respiratory infection, cough.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylaxis.

Precaution: Exclude malignancy, prolonged use, hepatic impairment. Pregnancy, lactation, children <1 yr. Elderly and Asians (increased bioavailability).

Mode of action: Omeprazole is a substituted benzimidazole gastric antisecretory agent and is also known as PPI. It blocks the final step in gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system present on the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Both basal and stimulated acid are inhibited.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased risk of hypomagnesaemia w/ diuretics. May increase INR and prothrombin time w/ warfarin. Increased risk of digoxin-induced cardiotoxic effects. May increase plasma concentration benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), clarithromycin and methotrexate. Decreased absorption of itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, dasatinib, iron salts. May prolong elimination of diazepam, cilostazol, phenytoin and ciclosporin. May reduce the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel.
Potentially Fatal: May decrease plasma concentrations and pharmacological effects of rilpivirine, nelfinavir and atazanavir.Beximco	Neokit Kit  14's pack 770 BDT
	Indication: H-pylori infection.

Dose: Each kit twice daily for 7-14 days. 

Contra-indication: Known hypersensitivity to any of its component.

Side effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dark stools, dry mouth, stomatitis, myalgia, confusion, headache, dizziness, vaginitis.

Precaution: Serious and occasional hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients on amoxycillin therapy. Elderly patients may suffer from hepatic and renal impairment.

Mode of action: Omeprazole is a substituted benzimidazole gastric antisecretory agent and is also known as PPI. It blocks the final step in gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system present on the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Both basal and stimulated acid are inhibited.

Metronidazole is converted to reduction products that interact w/ DNA to cause destruction of helical DNA structure and strand leading to a protein synthesis inhibition and cell death in susceptible organisms. It is active against most anaerobic protozoa, some gm+ve, gm-ve and facultative anaerobes.

Clarithromycin inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by penetrating the cell wall and binding to 50S ribosomal subunits. It has activity against a variety of aerobic and anaerobic gm+ve and gm-ve bacteria.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Omeprazole: Increased risk of hypomagnesaemia w/ diuretics. May increase INR and prothrombin time w/ warfarin. Increased risk of digoxin-induced cardiotoxic effects. May increase plasma concentration benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), clarithromycin and methotrexate. Decreased absorption of itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, dasatinib, iron salts. May prolong elimination of diazepam, cilostazol, phenytoin and ciclosporin. May reduce the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel.
Potentially Fatal: May decrease plasma concentrations and pharmacological effects of rilpivirine, nelfinavir and atazanavir.

Metronidazole: Concurrent use w/ disulfiram may produce psychotic reactions. May potentiate the effect of oral anticoagulants. May increase risk of lithium toxicity. May reduce the renal clearance resulting to increased toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. May increase serum levels of ciclosporin. May increase plasma levels of busulfan resulting to severe busulfan toxicity. Enhanced metabolism w/ phenobarbital and phenytoin resulting to decreased serum concentrations.

Clarithromycin: Reduced efficacy w/ CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine). Strong inducers of CYP450 system (e.g. efavirenz, rifampicin) may accelerate metabolism, thus lower plasma levels of clarithromycin. Inhibition of metabolism w/ ritonavir. Torsades de pointes may result from concomitant quinidine or disopyramide. Increased phosphodiesterase inhibitor exposure w/ sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil. Increased risk of digoxin toxicity. Decreased concentration of zidovudine. Concomitant use w/ atazanavir, itraconazole or saquinavir may result to bi-directional drug interactions. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis may result when taken w/ verapamil. Increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis w/ HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Increased risk of hypoglycaemia w/ oral hypoglycaemic drugs (e.g. pioglitazone) and insulin. Risk of serious haemorrhage and elevation of INR and prothrombin time w/ oral anticoagulants. Increased ototoxicity w/ aminoglycosides. Increased and prolonged sedation w/ triabenzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam).
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use w/ ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine or dihydroergotamine) is associated w/ acute ergot toxicity characterised by vasospasm and ischaemia of the extremities. Concomitant use w/ astemizole, cisapride, pimozide and terfenadine may result in QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia.Opsonin Pharma	Ometid IR CAP  60's pack 240 BDT
	Indication: Peptic ulcer disease, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Erosive Esophagitis 

Dose: Usually once daily on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before a meal. The powder form of this medication may also be given through a tube into the stomach (nasogastric or gastric tube). 

Contra-indication: Patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of the formulation.

Side effects: Diarrhoea, nausea, fatigue, constipation, vomiting, flatulence, acid regurgitation, taste perversion, arthralgia, myalgia, urticaria, dry mouth, dizziness, headache, paraesthesia, abdominal pain, skin rashes, weakness, back pain, upper respiratory infection, cough. Potentially Fatal: Anaphylaxis.

Precaution:  Exclude malignancy, prolonged use, hepatic impairment. Pregnancy, lactation, children <1 yr. 

Mode of action: Omeprazole is a substituted benzimidazole gastric antisecretory agent and is also known as PPI. It blocks the final step in gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system present on the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Both basal and stimulated acid are inhibited.

Sodium bicarbonate raises blood and urinary pH by dissociation to provide bicarbonate ions, which neutralises the hydrogen ion concentration. It also neutralises gastric acid via production of carbon dioxide.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Omeprazole: Increased risk of hypomagnesaemia w/ diuretics. May increase INR and prothrombin time w/ warfarin. Increased risk of digoxin-induced cardiotoxic effects. May increase plasma concentration benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam), clarithromycin and methotrexate. Decreased absorption of itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, dasatinib, iron salts. May prolong elimination of diazepam, cilostazol, phenytoin and ciclosporin. May reduce the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel.
Potentially Fatal: May decrease plasma concentrations and pharmacological effects of rilpivirine, nelfinavir and atazanavir.

Sodium bicarbonate: Increases toxicity of amphetamines, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, flecainide, quinidine and quinine. Decreases effects of lithium, chlorpropamide and salicylates due to increased clearance. May affect the absorption of certain drugs due to raised intra-gastric pH.ACI	Osetron Syrup 4mg/5ml 50ml bot 30.20 BDT

	Indication: Postpartum haemorrhage, Labour induction, Abortion, Facilitate lactation

Dose: Intravenous
Adjunct in abortion
Adult: 10-20 milliunits/minute. Max total dose: 30 units in a 12-hr period.

Postpartum haemorrhage
Adult: 10-40 units by infusion in 1000 mL of IV fluid at a rate sufficient to control uterine atony.

Labour induction
Adult: 1-2 milliunits/minute, may increase at intervals of at least 30 minutes until a max of 3-4 contractions occur every 10 minutes. Not to exceed 32 milliunits/minute and no more than a total of 5 units should be given in 1 day. Not to be given within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Monitor uterine contractions and foetal heart rate continuously. Withdraw gradually once labour is progressing.

Oxytocin challenge test for evaluating of foetal distress
Adult: Dilute 5-10 units in 1 L of 5% dextrose inj. Initially, administer the drug in the mother via IV infusion at a rate of 0.5 milliunits/minute. May gradually increase infusion rate at intervals of 15-30 minutes. Max: 20 milliunits/minute. Monitor foetal heart rate and uterine contractions immediately before and during infusion. Discontinue infusion when 3 moderate uterine contractions occur within one 10-minute interval. Compare baseline and oxytocin-induced foetal heart rates. If no change occurs, repeat the test in 1 wk. Termination of pregnancy may be required if a late deceleration in foetal heart rate occurs.

Contra-indication: Cephalopelvic disproportion; abnormal presentation of the foetus; hydraminios; multiparae; previous caesarian section or other uterine surgery; hyperactive or hypertonic uterus, uterine rupture; contraindicated vaginal delivery (invasive cervical cancer, active genital herpes, prolapse of the cord, cord presentation, total placenta previa or vasa previa); foetal distress where delivery is not imminent; severe pre-eclamptic toxaemia.

Side effects: Foetus or neonate: Jaundice; arrhythmias, bradycardia; brain, CNS damage; seizure; retinal haemorrhage; low Apgar score. Mother: transient hypotension, reflex tachycardia; nasal irritation, rhinorrhoea, lachrymation (following nasal admin); uterine bleeding, violent contractions, hypertonicity; spasm; nausea, vomiting.
Potentially Fatal: Maternal water intoxication (especially with slow infusion over 24 hr); prolonged uterine contractions causing foetal hypoxia and death; rupture of gravid uterus; afibrinogenaemia; subarachnoid haemorrhage

Precaution: CV disorders; >35 yr; lactation. Monitor foetal and maternal heart rate, maternal BP and uterine motility. Monitor fluid intake and output during treatment. Discontinute immediately if the uterus is hypertonic or hyperactive or if there is foetal distress. Use of nasal spray may produce maternal dependence on its effects. IM admin not regularly used due to unpredictable effects of oxytocin. Not to be used for prolonged periods in resistant uterine inertia, severe pre-eclampsia, or severe CV disorders. Risk of water intoxication when used at high doses for prolonged periods.

Mode of action: Uterine stimulant, vasopressive, & antidiuretic effects; activates G-protein-coupled receptors that trigger increases in intracellular calcium levels in uterine myofibrils, which results in uterine contractions; increases local prostaglandin production, which further stimulates uterine contraction.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Possible severe hypertension if given within 3-4 hr of vasoconstrictor in association with a caudal block anaesthesia. Cyclopropane anaesthesia may increase risk of hypotension and maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal AV rhythms. Dinoprostone and misoprostol may increase uterotonic effect of oxytocin, thus oxytocin should not be used within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Concurrent use may increase the vasopressor effect of sympathomimetics.

Potentially Fatal: Concomitant use with prostaglandins increases risk of uterine rupture and cervical lacerations.Beacon	Xelpac Injection 100mg/vial 1's pack 4500 BDT

Contra-indication: History of hypersensitivity (especially macrogol glycerol ricinolate). Patients with baseline neutropenia of <1500 cells/mm3 (<1000 cells/mm3 for kaposi's sarcoma). Pregnancy and lactation. In kaposi's sarcoma, contraindicated in patients with concurrent, serious, uncontrolled infections.


Side effects: Neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, bleeding; hypersensitivity reactions (dyspnoea, flushing, chest pain, tachycardia, rash, hypotension, hypertension); bradycardia, abnormal ECG; neurotoxicity (mainly peripheral neuropathy), myalgia, arthralgia; nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea; severe mucositis, alopecia; rarely hepatic necrosis and encephalopathy, inj site reactions e.g. erythema, tenderness, skin discolouration, swelling; interstitial pneumonitis; infections (mainly UTIs and upper respiratory tract); mucosal inflammation, severe elevation in LFTs (aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase).
Potentially Fatal: Infections and infestations leading to death e.g. pneumonia and peritonitis.

Precaution:  	Bone marrow suppression during therapy. Monitor cardiac function if conduction abnormalities result. Premedicaton (with corticosteroid, antihistamine and histamine H2-receptor antagonist) may be required to reduce risk of hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue, if severe reactions e.g. hypotension, dyspnoea, angioedema or urticaria occur. Caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Monitor for reactions of admin. Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients have not been established. Administer before platinum derivatives (cisplatin, carboplatin) if used in combination. Hazardous agent; use appropriate precautions for handling and disposal.


Mode of action: Paclitaxel promotes microtubule formation by enhancing the action of tubulin dimers, stabilising existing microtubules and preventing their disassembly, thereby disrupting normal cell division in the late G2 mitotic phase of the cell cycle. This results in the inhibition of cell replication.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Myelosuppression was more profound when given after cisplatin than with the alternate sequence (e.g., paclitaxel before cisplatin). CYP2C8 inducers e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifapentine, and secobarbital may reduce levels or effects. CYP2C8 inhibitors e.g. gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, montelukast, and ritonavir may increase levels or effects. CYP3A4 inducers e.g. aminoglutethimide, carbamazepine, nafcillin, nevirapine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifamycins may decrease the levels or effects. 

CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g. azole antifungals, clarithromycin, diclofenac, doxycycline, erythromycin, imatinib, isoniazid, nefazodone, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors, quinidine, telithromycin, and verapamil may increase levels or effects. May increase anthracycline (eg doxorubicin, epirubicin) levels or toxicity; admin of anthracycline at least 24 hr prior to paclitaxel may reduce interaction. May decrease the absorption of cardiac glycosides (may only affect digoxin tablets); levels should be monitored.Beacon	Paloxi Injection .075mg/1.0ml 1's pack 75 BDT

Renal impairment:
CrCl (ml/min)	
10-50	50% dose
<10 	avoid

Hepatic impairment: Hepatic impairment may result in a slower onset of action, higher initial dosage and longer neuromuscular blockade.


Contra-indication: Anuria. Relatively contraindicated in conditions of reduced airway control. Lactation.

Side effects: Tachycardia may occur due to vagal blockade and especially during light anaesthesia. May decrease intra-ocular pressure and induce miosis; excessive salivation; transient rashes and itching; wheezing; elevation in pulse rate, BP, cardiac output; erythema; burning sensation along vein; profound muscle weakness; bronchospasm; hypersensitivity reaction; acute quadriplegic myopathy syndrome, myositis ossificans.
Potentially Fatal: Rare anaphylactoid reactions; bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension and CV collapse; respiratory depression.

Precaution: Myasthenia gravis; severe electrolyte disorders; severe CV disease; pregnancy. Hepatic and renal function impairment. Hypothermia; jaundice; hypermagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoproteinaemia, acidosis, alkalosis, hypercalcemia. In obese patients, dose should be based on ideal body wt. Elderly; previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular-blocking agents. Burn patients (>30% of body) may be resistant to action for 5-70 days after injury. Demyelinating lesions, peripheral neuropathies, denervation, infection, muscle trauma, and DM may antagonise the neuromuscular blockade effects of drug. Neuromuscular diseases, acute intermittent porphyria, Eaton-Lambert syndrome. Maintain adequate airway and respiratory support during use.

Mode of action: Pancuronium bromide is a non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent with curarimimetic action through competitive blockade at the myoneural junction by binding with cholinergic receptor sites.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Neuroleptanalgaesia may decrease neuromuscular activity. Action may be prolonged and/or potentiated by aminoglycoside antibiotics, lithium, diazepam, lidocaine (high dose), quinidine, tetracyclines, propranolol, thiamine (high dose), parenteral magnesium sulphate, MAOIs, quinine, protamine, carbamazepine, donepezil and phenytoin (if pancuronium is given concurrently for <1 wk). Action may be decreased by neostigmine, edrophonium, high-dose or long term corticosteroids, adrenaline (may also potentiate effect), azathioprine, theophylline (high doses), clindamycin, nifedipine, piperacillin, polymixins, verapamil, procainamide. Furosemide may increase or decrease effects. TCAs may increase risk of arrhythmias and hypotension during anaesthesia.

Potentially Fatal: Potentiated by volatile anaesthetics (isoflurane and enflurane) and local anaesthetics. Prior admin of suxamethonium can increase the intensity of neuromuscular block. Concomitant use with digoxin may increase risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.ACI	Pantex TAB dr 40mg 30's pack 210.60 BDT

Immune system disorders (Rare, > 0.01% to < 0.1%): 

anaphylactoid reactions (hypersensitivity, mild influenza-like symptoms, bradycardia, tachycardia, bronchospasm, non-cardiac pulmonary edema). In the event of an intolerance reaction, the infusion should be discontinued immediately and the appropriate emergency medical treatment initiated. 

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (Common, > 1 to < 10%, dose dependent): Prolonged administration of high dosages of hydroxyethyl starch may cause pruritus (itching) which is an undesirable effect observed with all hydroxyethyl starches.



Precaution: Anaphylactoid reactions (mild influenza-like symptoms, 

bradycardia, tachycardia, bronchospasm, non-cardiac 

pulmonary edema) have been reported with solutions 

containing hydroxyethyl starch. If a hypersensitivity 

reaction occurs, administration of the drug should be 

discontinued immediately and the appropriate treatment 

and supportive measures should be undertaken until 

symptoms have resolved. 

Fluid status and rate of infusion should be assessed 

regularly during treatment, especially in patients with

	Indication: Constipation, Fecal impaction

Dose: Constipation: The dose is 1 sachet daily. This may be increased to 2-3 sachets daily, if required.        

Fecal Impaction: 8 sachets daily, consumed within 6 hours. A course of treatment for fecal impaction does not normally exceed 3 days. 

Contra-indication: Polyethylene glycol is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected bowel obstruction and patients known to be allergic to polyethylene glycol.

Side effects: Nausea, abdominal bloating, cramping and flatulence may occur. High doses may produce diarrhea and excessive stool frequency, particularly in elderly nursing home patients. Patients taking other medications containing polyethylene glycol have occasionally developed urticaria suggestive of an allergic reaction.

Precaution: Patients with impaired cardiovascular function: For the treatment of faecal impaction the dose should be divided so that no more than two sachets are taken in any one hour. If patients develop any symptoms indicating shifts of fluid/electrolytes (e.g. edema, shortness of breath, increasing fatigue, dehydration, cardiac failure) It should be stopped immediately and any abnormality should be treated appropriately. Prolonged use with all laxatives is undesirable and may lead to dependence. 

Patients with symptoms suggestive of bowel obstruction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or distention) should be evaluated to rule out this condition before initiating. 

Mode of action: Poly ethylene Glycol is an osmotic agent that causes water to be retained with the stool.It appears to have no effect on the active absorption or secretion of glucose or electrolytes.

Sodium chloride is the major extracellular cation. It is important in electrolyte and fluid balance, osmotic pressure control and water distribution as it restores sodium ions. It is used as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration, treatment of metabolic acidosis, priming solution in haemodialysis and treatment of hyperosmolar diabetes. It is also used as diluents for infusion of compatible drug additives. Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion. Sodium bicarbonate raises blood and urinary pH by dissociation to provide bicarbonate ions, which neutralises the hydrogen ion concentration. It also neutralises gastric acid via production of carbon dioxide.

Interaction:Indication: Hypokalemia

Dose: Usual Adult Dose for Hypokalemia
Oral:
40 to 100 mEq orally once a day given in equally divided doses using formulations which include normal-release tablets or capsules, extended-release tablets or capsules, dissolvable tablets, oral solution or powder for dissolution mixed with an appropriate volume of water or juice.

Usual Adult Dose for Prevention of Hypokalemia.

Oral:
10 to 20 mEq orally once a day given in equally divided doses using formulations which include normal-release tablets or capsules, extended-release tablets or capsules, dissolvable tablets, oral solution or powder for dissolution mixed with an appropriate volume of water or juice.
Usual Pediatric Dose for Hypokalemia

Treatment of hypokalemia: Note: High variability exists in dosing/infusion rate recommendations; therapy should be guided by patient condition and specific institutional guidelines.

Infants and Children:

Oral: 2 to 5 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; not to exceed 1 to 2 mEq/kg as a single dose; if deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, IV route should be considered preferred route of administration.

Normal daily requirements: Oral or IV:
Infants: 2 to 6 mEq/kg/day
Children: 2 to 3 mEq/kg/day

Prevention of hypokalemia during diuretic therapy:
Infants and Children: 1 to 2 mEq/kg/day orally in 1 to 2 divided doses

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Metabolic

Metabolic side effects have been reported rarely and have usually resulted from hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia is relatively high in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency.

Gastrointestinal

Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects have been reported from orally administered potassium chloride. They have included bad taste or aftertaste, nausea (10% to 30%), abdominal pain (20%), diarrhea (25%), dyspepsia or "heartburn" (5% to 20%) and GI ulceration. They have rarely included gastric or small bowel obstruction associated with the use of solid preparations.

All solid KCl preparations can cause erosive damage to the GI mucosa, especially when they are administered in high doses with an anticholinergic agent. Anticholinergic agents increase GI transit (and potassium-mucosa contact) time.

Patients at higher risk of GI lesions include the elderly, the immobile and those with scleroderma, diabetes mellitus, mitral valve replacement, cardiomegaly or esophageal stricture. 

Nearly half of all patients complain of a bad taste or aftertaste.

Liquid KCl may be a better choice for patients with a history of esophageal stenosis or left atrial enlargement.

Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity side effects have been reported rarely. They have included a single case of contact dermatitis.
Dermatologic

Dermatologic side effects have rarely included skin rash.

Precaution: Potassium chloride (KCl) is contraindicated in the presence of hyperkalemia; renal failure and conditions in which potassium retention is present, including the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics (such as triamterene, amiloride, or spironolactone); oliguria or azotemia; anuria; crush syndrome; severe hemolytic reactions; adrenocortical insufficiency (untreated Addison's disease); adynamical episodica hereditaria; acute dehydration; heat cramps; and early postoperative oliguria except during gastrointestinal drainage.

Patients should not use potassium-rich salt substitutes without the advice of their healthcare professional during KCl therapy.

In patients with renal insufficiency, use of potassium chloride may cause potassium intoxication and life-threatening hyperkalemia.

Solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride can produce ulcerative and/or stenotic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. Potassium chloride should be discontinued immediately and the possibility of ulceration, obstruction, or perforation should be considered if severe vomiting, abdominal pain, distention, or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs.

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory evaluations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the administration of additional electrolyte supplements, or the administration of electrolyte-free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added.

Certain potassium chloride extended-release tablets contain a wax matrix. This matrix is not absorbed and is excreted in the feces. In some instances the empty matrices may be noticeable in the stool.

Dose selection in the elderly should be cautious and should start at the lower end of the dosing range.

Mode of action: Potassium depletion occurs when rate of loss through renal excretion and/or GI tract exceeds intake. Supplementation with potassium-containing products may alleviate depletion. Potassium plays essential role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle; plays a role in contraction of cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscles.

Potassium chloride is a major cation of the intracellular fluid. It plays an active role in the conduction of nerve impulses in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle; contraction of cardiac skeletal and smooth muscles; maintenance of normal renal function, acid-base balance, carbohydrate metabolism and gastric secretion.

Precaution: Pregnancy, lactation. Hyperkalaemia, hyperthyroidism, myotonia congenita, renal function impairment, tuberculosis, hypocomplementemic vasculitis, goiter, autoimmune thyroid disease. Child. Repeated admin not recommended in neonatesdue to risk of hypothyroidism.

Mode of action: Potassium iodide participates in a complex series of reactions in the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. When used for hyperthyroidism, it rapidly inhibits the release of thyroid hormones via a direct effect on the thyroid gland and inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Vascularity of the thyroid gland is reduced. When used in radiation emergencies, oral potassium iodide is admin before or promptly after intake of radioactive iodine, blocks thyroidal uptake of radioactive isotopes of iodine, thereby minimizing the risk of radiation-induced thyroid neoplasms. As an antifungal agent, it results in rapid cell destruction.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Concurrent use with antithyroid agents may lead additional hypothyroid effect. Concurrent use with potassium-containing drugs or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to hyperkalaemia.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use with lithium salts may lead to additive hypothyroid effect.ACI	Rovidone Eye Drops  5% 10 ml drop 80.54 BDT

Mode of action: Propafenone is a class 1C antiarrhythmic drug with local anaesthetic effects, and a direct stabilising action on myocardial membranes. The electrophysiological effect manifests itself in a reduction of upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential. In Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser extent myocardial fibers, propafenone reduces the fast inward current carried by sodium ions. Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity.

Pregnancy category: C

Popular	P-caine Eye Drops 0.5% 10 ml plastic dropper bottle  BDT
	Indication: Corneal anesthesia, Foreign Bodies & Suture Removal

Dose: Deep anesthesia as in cataract extraction:

Instill 1 drop every 5 to 10 minutes for 5 to 7 doses.

Removal of sutures:

Instill 1 or 2 drops 2 or 3 minutes before removal of stitches.

Removal of foreign bodies:

Instill 1 or 2 drops prior to operating.

Tonometry:

Instill 1 or 2 drops immediately before measurement.


Contra-indication: This preparation is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the solution. This product should never be prescribed for the patient's own use.

Side effects: Pupillary dilatation or cycloplegic effects have rarely been observed with proparacaine hydrochloride. The drug appears to be safe for use in patients sensitive to other local anesthetics, but local or systemic sensitivity occasionally occurs. Instillation of proparacaine in the eye at recommended concentration and dosage usually produces little or no initial irritation, stinging, burning, conjunctival redness, lacrimation or increased winking. However, some local irritation and stinging may occur several hours after the instillation. Rarely, a severe immediate-type, apparently hyperallergic corneal reaction may occur which includes acute, intense and diffuse epithelial keratitis; a gray, ground-glass appearance; sloughing of large areas of necrotic epithelium; corneal filaments and, sometimes, iritis with descemetitis. Allergic contact dermatitis with drying and fissuring of the fingertips has been reported. Softening and erosion of the corneal epithelium and conjunctival congestion and hemorrhage have been reported.

Precaution: Proparacaine hydrochloride should be used cautiously and sparingly in patients with known allergies, cardiac disease, or hyperthyroidism. The long-term toxicity of proparacaine is unknown, prolonged use may possibly delay wound healing. Although exceedingly rare with ophthalmic application of local anesthetics, it should be borne in mind that systemic toxicity (manifested by central nervous system stimulation followed by depression) may occur. Protection of the eye from irritating chemicals, foreign bodies and rubbing during the period of anesthesia is very important. Tonometers soaked in sterilizing or detergent solutions should be thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water prior to use. Patients should be advised to avoid touching the eye until the anesthesia has worn off.
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity, or possible impairment oi fertility in males or females.

Mode of action: Reversibly blocks nerve conduction near the site of application. May limit sodium ion permeability through the lipid layer of the nerve cell membrane.

Dose: Adults
Hypertension: As starting dose of 80mg twice a day may increased at weekly intervals according to response. The usual dose range is 160-320mg per day. With concurrentdiuretic or other antihypertensive drugs a further reduction of blood pressure is obtained.

Angina, anxiety,migraine and essential tremor:
A staring dose of 40mg two or three times daily may be increased by the same amount at weekly intervals according to patients’ response. An adequate response in anxiety, migraine and essential tremor is usually seen in the range 80-160mg/day and an angina in the range 120-240mg/day.

Situational and generalized anxiety:
A dose of 40mg daily may provide short term relief of acute situational anxiety.
Generalized anxiety require long term therapy, usually responds adequately to 40mg twice daily which, which individual cases, may be increased to 40mg three times daily. Treatment should be continued according to responses. Patients shouldreviewed after 6 to12 months treatment.

Dysarhythmias, anxiety tachycardia, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and thyrotoxicosis:
A dosage range of 10-40mg three or four times a day usually achieves the required response.

Post myocardial infarction:Treatment should be started between days 5 and after 21 after myocardial infarction,with an initial dose of 40mg four times a day for 2 or 3 days. In order to improve compliance the total daily doses three after be given as 80mg twice a day.

Phaeochromocytoma (Used only with an alpha receptor blocking drug).
Pre-operative: 60mg daily for three days. Non-operable malignant cases: 30mg daily.

Children: Sysrhythmias, Phaeochromocytoma,Thyrotoxicisis: Dosage should be individually determined and the following is only a guide.0.25-0.5mg/kg three or four times daily as required.

Migraine Under 12 years: 20mg two or three times daily.
Over 12 years: The adult dose.

As Extended release Capsule:
Hypertension
Dosage Must Be Individualized. The usual initial dosage is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. The dosage may be increased to 120 mg once daily or higher until adequate blood pressure control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage is 120 to 160 mg once daily. In some instances a dosage of 640 mg may be required. The time needed for full hypertensive response to a given dosage is variable and may range from a few days to several weeks.

Angina Pectoris

Dosage Must Be Individualized. Starting with 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily, dosage should be gradually increased at three- to seven-day intervals until optimal response is obtained. Although individual patients may respond at any dosage level, the average optimal dosage appears to be 160 mg once daily. In angina pectoris, the value and safety of dosage exceeding 320 mg per day have not been established.

If treatment is to be discontinued, reduce dosage gradually over a period of a few weeks.

Migraine
Dosage Must Be Individualized. The initial oral dose is 80 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily. The usual effective dose range is 160 to 240 mg once daily. The dosage may be increased gradually to achieve optimal migraine prophylaxis. If a satisfactory response is not obtained within four to six weeks after reaching the maximal dose, propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules therapy should be discontinued. It may be advisable to withdraw the drug gradually over a period of several weeks.

Hypertrophic Subaortic Stenosis
80 mg to 160 mg propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules once daily.



Contra-indication: Propranolol hydrochloride is contraindicated in 1) cardiogenic shock; 2) sinus bradycardia and greater than first-degree block; 3) bronchial asthma; 4) congestive heart failure (see WARNINGS), unless the failure is secondary to a tachyarrhythmia treatable with propranolol hydrochloride.

Side effects: Most adverse effects have been mild and transient and have rarely required the withdrawal of therapy.

Cardiovascular: Bradycardia; congestive heart failure; intensification of AV block; hypotension; paresthesia of hands; thrombocytopenic purpura; arterial insufficiency, usually of the Raynaud type.

Central Nervous System: Lightheadedness; mental depression manifested by insomnia, lassitude, weakness, fatigue; reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; visual disturbances; hallucinations; vivid dreams; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on neuropsychometrics. For immediate formulations, fatigue, lethargy, and vivid dreams appear dose related.

Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, constipation, mesenteric arterial thrombosis, and ischemic colitis.

Allergic: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, pharyngitis and agranulocytosis, erythematous rash, fever combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress.

Respiratory: Bronchospasm.

Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, and thrombocytopenic purpura.

Skin: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and urticaria.

Precaution: Propranolol should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function. Propranolol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies.

Beta-adrenoreceptor blockade can cause reduction of intraocular pressure. Patients should be told that propranolol may interfere with the glaucoma screening test. Withdrawal may lead to a return of increased intraocular pressure.

Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction


While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.

Mode of action: Propranolol is a non-cardioselective ?-blocker that competitively blocks ?1- and ?2-receptors resulting in decreased heart rate, myocardial contractility, BP and myocardial oxygen demand. It has membrane-stabilising properties.

Pregnancy category: D

Interaction: Antidiabetics, verapamil, diltiazem, lignocaine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, indomethacin, chlorpromazine, anaesth, disopyramide, quinidine, amiodarone, digitalis glycosides, cimetidine, hydralazine, adrenaline, alcohol.Indication: Heparin overdosage, Heparin neutralisation, Enoxaparin or dalteparin overdosage

Dose: Adult: IV Heparin overdosage Dosage depends heparin dose, its route of administration, time elapsed since heparin dose and blood coagulation studies. For heparin administered via IV inj: If only a few mins have elapsed since heparin dose, 1-1.5 mg per 100 u of heparin administered; if 30 mins have elapsed since heparin dose, 0.5 mg per 100 u of heparin and, if >2 hr have elapsed since heparin dose, 0.25-0.375 mg per 100 u of heparin; doses to be given via IV inj at rate >5 mg/minute. 

For heparin administered via IV infusion: 25-50 mg via inj after stopping heparin infusion. For heparin administered via SC inj: 1-1.5 mg via inj per 100 u of heparin administered. Heparin neutralisation during extracorporeal circulation 1.5 mg per 100 u of heparin administered. 

Enoxaparin or dalteparin overdosage Dose depends on the administered dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), time elapsed since drug was administered and blood coagulation tests. 

For enoxaparin: If <8 hr since LMWH dose, dose should be equal to that of the administered enoxaparin dose; if >8 hr has elapsed since LMWH dose, infuse 0.5 mg per mg of enoxaparin Na administered; if >12 hr has elapsed since LMWH dose, protamine may not be needed.

 For dalteparin: 1 mg per 100 anti-Xa u of dalteparin administered. If aPTT remains prolonged 2-4 hr after the 1st infusion, a 2nd infusion may be given.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Hypotension, bradycardia, pulmonary and systemic hypertension, dyspnoea, warm sensation, transitory flushing, nausea and vomiting, lassitude.
Potentially Fatal: Severe hypersensitivity reactions e.g. CV collapse, fatal anaphylactic reaction; noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema with prolonged hypotension (rare).

Precaution: Avoid rapid admin as this may cause severe hypotension and anaphylactoid reactions. Patients at risk of developing hypersensitivity to protamine (e.g previous history of procedures such as coronary angioplasty or cardio-pulmonary bypass which may include protamine, diabetics using protamine insulin, allergy to fish, vasectomised or infertile males who may have antibodies to protamine. Monitor aPTT or activated coagulation time, 5-15 minutes after protamine sulfate admin. Monitor clotting parameters closely especially in prolonged procedures as rebound bleeding may occur up to 18 hr after operation. Pregnancy, lactation, children.

Mode of action: Protamine sulfate, prepared from the sperm or mature testes of salmon or related species, is a heparin antagonist. It combines with heparin to form a stable inactive complex. Protamine sulfate is often used in the treatment of bleeding from severe heparin overdose and should not be used in minor overdose/bleeding as heparin withdrawal will usually correct itself within a few hr. For LMWH, protamine sulfate neutralises the anti-thrombin activity but only partly neutralises the anti-factor-Xa effect. When admin in the absence of heparin, protamine sulfate has an anticoagulant effect. Protamine is not useful for reversing the effects of oral anticoagulants.

Side effects: Intralipid infusion may cause a rise in body temperature and, less frequently, shivering, chills and nausea/vomiting (incidence<1%).

Precaution: Intralipid should be given with caution in conditions of impaired lipid metabolism as in renal insufficiency, uncompensated diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, impaired liver function, hypothyroidism (if hypertri-glyceridemic) and sepsis. If Intralipid is given to patients with these conditions, close monitoring of the serum triglyceride concentration is obligatory.

This medicinal product contains soya-bean oil and egg phospholipids, which may rarely cause allergic reactions. Cross allergic reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut.

Intralipid should be given with caution to neonates and prematures with hyperbilirubinemia and cases with suspected pulmonary hypertension. In neonates, particularly prematures on long term parenteral nutrition, platelet count, liver tests and serum triglyceride concentration should be monitored.

Intralipid may interfere with certain laboratory measurements (bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, oxygen saturation, Hb etc) if blood is sampled before fat has been adequately cleared from the blood stream. Fat is cleared after a fat free interval of 5-6 hours in most patients.

Mode of action: Pyrazinamide may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in action, depending on the concentration of the drug attained at the site of the infection and the susceptibility of the infecting organism. Its activity appears to partly depend on conversion of the drug to pyrazinoic acid (POA), which lowers the pH of the environment below that which is necessary for growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis produce pyrazinamidase, an enzyme that deaminates pyrazinamide to POA, and the in vitro susceptibility of a given strain of the organism appears to correspond to its pyrazinamidase activity.

Sanofi Aventis (BD) Ltd.	Favirab Solution 1000 IU/5ml 1's pack 1758 BDT
	Indication: Postexposure prophylaxis of rabies.

Dose: Injection
Post exposure prophylaxis of rabies: The recommended dose for both adults and children is 40 IU/kg of body weight.
Adult: In conjunction with rabies vaccine in previously unvaccinated individuals: admin as soon as possible at the same time as vaccine, or up to 7 days after vaccine inj. Recommended dose to be infiltrated thoroughly in and around the cleansed wound; any remainder to be injected via IM inj in area distant to that of vaccine inoculation e.g. anterior thigh. If calculated dose is not enough to infiltrate all wounds, dilute 2-3 folds with sterile saline to allow thorough infiltration. Previously vaccinated individuals with adequate rabies antibody titer: Rabies immunoglobulin should not be admin; only vaccine should be given.

Child: In conjunction with rabies vaccine in previously unvaccinated individuals: admin as soon as possible at the same time as vaccine, or up to 7 days after vaccine inj. Recommended dose to be infiltrated thoroughly in and around the cleansed wound; any remainder to be injected via IM inj in area distant to that of vaccine inoculation e.g. anterior thigh. If calculated dose is not enough to infiltrate all wounds, dilute 2-3 folds with sterile saline to allow thorough infiltration. Previously vaccinated individuals with adequate rabies antibody titer: Rabies immunoglobulin should not be admin; only vaccine should be given.


Contra-indication: Known history of allergic symptoms to horse proteins. Do not give repeated doses of rabies immunoglobulin once rabies vaccine is given as this may reduce the immunologic response to the vaccine.

Side effects: Soreness at inj site, fever, chest or joint pain, dyspnoea, tremor, dizziness, oedema of the face, glossitis, buccal ulceration. The observed immediate reactions are hypotension, dyspnoea, and urticaria. Delayed reactions consist of inflammatory reaction, fever, pruritis, rash or urticaria, adenopathy and arthralgia. Rare risk of disease transmission by infective agents.
Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions.

Precaution: Hypersensitivity to human immune globulin preparations, increased risk of hypersensitivity with specific immunoglobulin A deficiency; epinephrine should be available for management of possible anaphylactic reactions. Thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders. If IM inj is contra-indicated, inj may be given by SC with pressure and compress applied to site after inj. 

Do not exceed recommended doses as this may reduce the immune response to rabies vaccine. Patients preciously immunised with rabies vaccine and have adequate rabies antibody titer should receive rabies vaccine without the rabies immunoglobulin. Avoid IV admin, and IM inj into central region of gluteal area. Admin rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine in separate syringes and to different sites with different lymphatic drainage. Pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: Rabies immunoglobulins provide passive immunity to rabies. 2 types of immunoglobulin are available namely, human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) and purified equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG). HRIG is prepared from the plasma of human donors hyperimmunised with rabies vaccine and is preferred over ERIG.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Decreased response to live virus vaccine (e.g. measles, mumps, rubella and varicella), admin at least 4 mth after human rabies immunoglobulin admin.Incepta	Rabix-VC Injection  2.5 IU/ml 1's  500 BDT

b) Post-exposure treatment Intramuscular schedule: 
Non-vaccinated individuals: Treatment consists of 5 injections. Intramuscular injections to be given on Day 0, D3, D7, D14 and D28 subsequent to contact with an animal confirmed or suspected of being rabid. In case of severe (WHO category 3) wounds, immunoglobulin should be administered as soon as possible. 

Fully vaccinated individuals: If vaccine administered in less than 5 years of exposure (cell culture rabies vaccine): 2 injections on D0, D3. If vaccine administered in more than 5 years of exposure or incomplete vaccination: 5 injections on D0, D3, D7, D14 and D28 with administration of immunoglobulin if required. Post exposure vaccination must be administered on the basis of severity under medical supervision.

Intradermal schedules: One intradermal (ID) dose is comprised of 0.1 ml.
WHO Modified Thai Red Cross (2-2-2-0-2) schedule: Day 0: 2 injections each of 0.1 ml at separate sites, Day 3: 2 injections each of 0.1 ml at separate sites, Day 7: 2 injections each of 0.1 ml at separate sites, Day 28: 2 injections each of 0.1 ml at separate sites.

To reconstitute the vaccine, transfer content of supplied diluent into the vial containing freeze-dried preparation. Do not shake. After reconstitution the solution should be homogeneous, clear and free from any particles. Vaccine must be injected immediately after reconstitution and the syringe should be destroyed after use. 


Contra-indication: Pre-exposure
Severe fever, febrile infection, acute disease, progressive chronic diseases. Known hypersensitivity reactions to rabies vaccine or any of its components.

Post-exposure
No contraindication to post-exposure treatment, because rabies is lethal disease, any  contraindication to exposure, treatment should be considered carefully before disqualifying an individual for anti-rabies treatment.

Side effects: Minor local  reactions like pain, erythema, oedema, pruritus and induration at the injection site and lasting to 24-48 hours. Moderate fever, shivering, fainting, asthenia, dizziness, respiratory manifestations (dyspnoea, wheezing), fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and allergic skin reactions (urticaria, rash, itching). 

Precaution:  Possibility of immune complex reaction 2-21 days after booster doses of HDCV (Human diploid cell cultures rabies vaccine); symptoms include arthralgia, arthritis, nausea, malaise, angioedema, fever and vomiting. Caution when used in patients with bleeding disorders, patients on anticoagulant treatment, severely immunocompromised patients. Not to be used in patients with confirmed diagnosis of rabies. Postexposure prophylaxis may be started regardless of the length of time from likely exposure, as long as clinical signs of rabies infection are not present. Pregnancy, lactation.

Mode of action: Rabies vaccine is an inactivated virus vaccine that is used for active immunisation against rabies. It can be used for pre- and post-exposure immunisation. For post-exposure immunisation, it is often used in conjunction with rabies immunoglobulins as it takes about 7-10 days for the specific antibodies to develop.

	Indication: Acute diarrhoea

Dose: Adults: PO: 1 capsule initially, regardless of the time of day. Then 1capsule 3 times daily preferably before the main meals up to 7 days. 

Children: The recommended dose is determined according to body weight: 1.5 mg/kg per administration, three times daily.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to Racecadotril, or to any of the excipients. 

Side effects: Headache, erythema multiforme, urticaria, angioedema, vomiting, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, thirst, vertigo.

Precaution: Chronic & antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, bloddy or purulent stools & fever, patients w/ diabetes, renal or liver impairment, cases of prolonged or uncontrolled vomiting. Pregnancy, lactation.

Mode of action: Racecadotril increases the availability of endogenous opioids (enkephalins) by inhibiting the membrane-bound enkephalinase. These enkephalins activate ?-opioid receptors in the GI tract. This leads to a reduction in cAMP mucosal levels, resulting in a reducted secretion of water and electrolytes in the intestinal lumen.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction: No interactions with other drugs have been described in humans to date.
In humans, the concomitant treatment of Hidrasec with loperamide or nifuroxazide does not modify the kinetics of Hidrasec.

Dose: Do not use more than directed    The ingredient is used in an aqueous solution at a concentration equivalent to 1 percent epinephrine    For use in a Hand-held Bulb Nebulizer:    Racepinephrine inhalation solution does not require dilution    For use in a Jet Nebulizer:    One 0.5 mL vial should be diluted to a volume of 3 to 5 mL with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution?    Adults and children 4 years of age and over:        Hand-held Bulb Nebulizer: 1 to 3 inhalations not more often than every 3 hours        Jet Nebulizer: Administer for fifteen minutes every 3 to 4 hours?    Do not use more than 12 inhalations in 24 hours. The use of this product by children should be supervised by an adult.?    Children under 4 years of age: ask a doctor. 

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity.

Side effects: Cardiovascular

Cardiovascular side effects have included elevations of heart rate and blood pressure. In smaller doses, racepinephrine has caused peripheral coronary arterial vasodilation, but in larger doses, racepinephrine has caused diffuse vasoconstriction. This has caused increased peripheral vascular resistance, which was important in patients with coronary artery disease (worsened myocardial ischemia/angina) or hypertension (risk of emergent hypertension/stroke).

Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in patients with underlying cardiac disease. Rapid rises in blood pressure have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Angina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease.
Gastrointestinal

Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea and vomiting.
Nervous system

Nervous system side effects have included fear, agitation, anxiety, tenseness, restlessness, headache, tremor, dizziness, lightheadedness, nervousness, sleeplessness, excitability, weakness, and increased parkinsonian tremors.
Psychiatric

Psychiatric side effects have included agitation, disorientation, impaired memory, aggressive or assautive behavior, hallucinations, and psychosis.

Precaution:  Asthma alert: Because asthma may be life threatening, see a doctor if you:

    Are not better in 20 minutes
    Get worse
    Need more than 12 inhalations in 24 hours
    Use more than 9 inhalations in 24 hours for 3 or more days a week
    Have more than 2 asthma attacks in a week

These may be signs that your asthma is getting worse.

Mode of action: Racemic epinephrine works by stimulation of the ?-adrenergic receptors in the airway with resultant tightening of the mucosa (mucosal vasoconstriction) and decreased fluid in the airway (subglottic edema) and by stimulation of the ?-adrenergic receptors causing relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle.

	Indication: Post-menopausal osteoporosis, Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours

Dose: One tablet (60 mg) once daily orally. It can be taken without regard to meal. High fat meal increases the absorption of Raloxifene.

Contra-indication: Hepatic & renal impairment.In active or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and retinal vein thrombosis.Hypersensitivity to Raloxifene or any other constituents of the tablet.

Side effects: Raloxifene is generally well tolerated. However, a few side effects like hot flushes, leg cramps, and influenza like symptoms, gastro-intestinal disturbances etc may be seen usually during first 6 months of treatment and were not different from placebo.

Precaution: Concurrent Estrogen Therapy: Concomitant use of Raloxifene with systemic estrogens is not recommended.Lipid Metabolism: Concurrent use of Raloxifene and lipid-lowering agents has not been studied.

Mode of action: Raloxifene is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator that has both selective agonist or antagonist activities on oestrogen receptors. It acts as an agonist on bone by preventing bone loss and partially on cholesterol metabolism by decreasing total and LDL cholesterol levels but antagonises oestrogen effects leading to development of breast and uterine cancer.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Cholestyramine reduces the absorption of raloxifene. Raloxifene with warfarin may reduce the prothrombin response and time. Caution when used in hghly protein-bound drugs such as diazepam, lidocaine and diazoxide.Acme Ltd.	Unipril TAB dr 2.5mg 30's pack 150.30 BDT

Dose: Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)

Generally, a dosage of 0.16 to 0.24 mg/kg body weight /week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.

Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS)

Generally, a dosage of 0.24 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.

Small for Gestational Age (SGA)

Generally, a dosage of up to 0.48 mg/kg body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.

Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS)

Generally, a dose up to 0.47 mg/kg of body weight/week is recommended. The weekly dose should be divided over 6 or 7 days of subcutaneous injections.
Dosing of Adult Patients
Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD)

Based on the weight-based dosing utilized in clinical studies with another somatropin product, the recommended dosage at the start of therapy is not more than 0.04 mg/kg/week given as a daily subcutaneous injection. The dose may be increased at 4- to 8-week intervals according to individual patient requirements to not more than 0.08 mg/kg/week. Clinical response, side effects, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum IGF-I levels may be used as guidance in dose titration.

Alternatively, taking into account recent literature, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15-0.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight. This dose can be increased gradually every 1-2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF-I concentrations. During therapy, the dose should be decreased if required by the occurrence of adverse events and/or serum IGF-I levels above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person.

A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men. Oral estrogen administration may increase the dose requirements in women.

Contra-indication:     Acute Critical Illness
    Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome who are severely obese or have severe respiratory impairment—reports of sudden death
    Active Malignancy
    Active Proliferative or Severe Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
    Children with closed epiphyses
    Known hypersensitivity to somatropin or excipients


Side effects: Injection site reactions/rashes and lipoatrophy and headaches.
Sudden death in pediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome with risk factors including severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea and unidentified respiratory infection
Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, in teenagers/young adults treated with radiation to the head as children for a first neoplasm and somatropin.
Glucose intolerance including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well as overt diabetes mellitus.

Precaution:     Acute Critical Illness: Potential benefit of treatment continuation should be weighed against the potential risk
    Prader-Willi Syndrome in children: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur
    Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or recurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin–in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm
    Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus: May be unmasked. Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in diabetics may require adjustment

    Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: May develop. Evaluate children with the onset of a limp or hip/knee pain
    Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis: May develop
    Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Turner syndrome: Patients with Turner syndrome should be evaluated for otitis media and other ear disorders and monitored for cardiovascular disorders
    Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain, especially children
    Adverse events and death associated with benzyl alcohol: Formulations containing benzyl alcohol (5 mg/1.5 mL Omnitrope Cartridges and the Bacteriostatic Water for Injection diluent for the O

Mode of action: Somatropin is a synthetic human growth hormone of recombinant DNA origin. It stimulates skeletal and soft tissue growth by promoting cell division, amino acid uptake and protein synthesis. It also possesses both insulin-like and diabetogenic effects.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Concomitant corticosteroid therapy may inhibit the effect of somatropin. Gonadotropins, oestrogens, androgens & anabolic agents.Indication: Female infertility,  (LH) and FSH deficiency

Dose: Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response. A recommended regimen commences at lutropinalpha 75 IU (ie, 1 vial of Luveris) daily with FSH 75-150 IU.

If an FSH, dose increase is deemed appropriate; dose adaptation should preferably be after 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any 1 cycle to up to 5 weeks.

When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5000-10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hrs after the last Luveris and FSH injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to gonadotropins or to any of the excipients of Luveris.
Ovarian, uterine or mammary carcinoma; active, untreated tumors of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland; ovarian enlargement or cyst not due to polycystic ovarian disease; gynecological hemorrhages of unknown origin.
Use in pregnancy & lactationThis should not be administered during pregnancy and lactation.

Side effects: General Description: Lutropin alpha is used for the stimulation of follicular development in association with follitropin alpha. In this context, it is difficult to attribute adverse reactions to any one of the substances used.
There is considerable post-marketing safety experience with human luteinizing hormone (hLH)-containing medicinal products of urinary origin. The safety profile of Luveris is expected to be very similar to that of urine-derived hLH, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions and application site disorders.
In a clinical trial, mild and moderate injection site reactions (bruising, pain, redness, itching or swelling) were reported in 7.4% and 0.9% of the injections, respectively. No severe injection site reactions were reported. To date, no systemic allergic reactions have been reported following Luveris administration.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome was observed in <6% of patients treated with Luveris. No severe OHSS was reported.
Ectopic pregnancy may also occur, especially in women with a history of prior tubal disease.

Precaution: Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated.
It should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained eg, ovarian failure, malformation of the sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy or fibroid tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.
In addition, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency and hyperprolactinemia and, pituitary or hypothalmic tumors, and appropriate specific treatment given.
Patients undergoing follicular growth stimulation are at increased risk of developing hyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular development.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can become a serious medical event characterised by large ovarian cysts which are prone to rupture. Excessive ovarian response seldom gives rise to significant hyperstimulation unless hCG is administered to induce ovulation. It is therefore prudent to withhold hCG in such cases and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or use barrier methods for at least 4 days.
Careful monitoring of ovarian response, based on ultrasound is recommended prior to and during stimulation therapy, especially in patients with polycystic ovaries.
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception.

Mode of action: Luteinizing hormone binds to a receptor shared with the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) on the ovarian theca (and granulosa) cells and testicular Leydig cells. This LH/CG transmembrane receptor is a member of the super-family of G protein-coupled receptors. Adenylate cyclase then activates many other pathways leading to steroid hormone production and other follicle maturation processes.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction: Luveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except follitropin ? for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances.

Incompatibilities: Luveris must not be mixed with other medicinal products except follitropin ?.Popular	Fatisol IV injection 10g+1.2g+2.25g 100ml/250ml/500ml tube 800.85/510.43/334.42 BDT

Adult: Initial infusion rate is 1ml/min for the first 15 to 30 mins. If no adverse reactions occur, the infusion rate can be increased to 2 ml/min. Infuse only 500 ml the first day and increase dose the following day. Do not exceed a daily dosage of 2.5 g/kg. 
Children: Initial infusion rate is 0.1ml/min for the first 10 to 15 mins. If no adverse reactions occur, the infusion rate can be increased to 1g/kg in 4 hours. Do not exceed a daily dosage of 3 g/kg. 
Infants: Starts at 0.5g/kg/24 hours and may be increased in relation to the infant's ability to eliminate fat. The maximum recommended dosage is 3g/kg/24 hours. 
Fatty acid deficiency: To correct EFAD, supply 8% to 10% of the caloric intake by IV fat emulsion to provide an adequate amount of linoleic acid. 

Contra-indication: It is contraindicated in conditions with severely disordered fat metabolism, such as in severe liver damage and acute shock. Hypersensitivity to egg-, soya- or peanut protein or to any of active substances or excipients.

Side effects: This may cause a rise in body temperature (incidence <3%) and, less frequently, shivering, chills and nausea/vomiting (incidence <1%). Reports of other adverse events in conjunction with 10% fat emulsion infusion are extremely rare, less than one report of certain events per one million infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic reaction, skin rash, urticaria), respiratory symptoms (tachypnoea) and circulatory effects (hypertension, hypotension) have been described. 
Thrombosis, haemolysis, reticulocytosis, abdominal pain, tiredness, priapism and neurological adverse reactions including headaches, flushing, dyspnoea, slight pressure over the eyes and dizziness have been reported.

Precaution: This contains soya oil and egg lecithin which may rarely cause allergic reactions. Cross allergic reaction has been observed between soya-bean and peanut. Fat metabolism may be disturbed in conditions such as renal insufficiency, uncompensated diabetes, pancreatitis, certain forms of liver insufficiency, metabolic disorders and sepsis. Fatisol should be administered with caution as a strong correlation exists between C-reactive protein and the agglutination of Fatisol in seriously ill patients. 

It should be given with caution to neonates and premature infants with hyperbilirubinaemia and in cases with suspected pulmonary hypertension. In low birthweight infants, the risk of lipid infusions may outweigh potential benefits due to further diminution of defences against infection. In infants, metabolism of lipids in peripheral tissues may be diminished by infection and heparin administration. In neonates receiving long term parenteral nutrition, particularly premature neonates, platelet count, liver function tests and serum triglyceride concentration should be monitored. Use in Pregnancy & Lactation: Absolute safety of the foetus and the nursing infant has not been established. Therefore,it should be administered with caution during pregnancy and lactation.

Mode of action: This are isotonic and may be given by central or peripheral venous route. FatisolTM is formulated as a concentrated source of energy to be used together with carbohydrates and amino acids in parenteral nutrition, it is isotonic, and provides a source of basal phosphate requirements and a source of vitamin E.

Bacterial over growth of irritable bowel syndrome: 400 mg 3 times daily for 10 days or 550 mg 3 times daily for 14 days.


Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of Rifaximin in patients with impaired renal function has not been studied.
Hepatic Impairment: The systemic exposure of Rifaximin was markedly elevated in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects.

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to Rifaximin or to any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any components of this product.

Side effects: Side effects include flatulence, headache, abdominal pain, rectal tenesmus, defecation urgency, nausea, constipation, pyrexia, vomiting. Reactions have been reported, including anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, and exfoliative dermatitis.

Precaution: Rifaximin is not found to be effective in patients with diarrhea complicated by fever and/or blood in the stools. Rifaximin therapy should be discontinued if diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist for more than 24-48 hours and an alternative antibiotic therapy should be considered. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.

Mode of action: Antimicrobial action is a result of binding to the beta-subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, resulting in inhibition of transcription.

Hepatic encephalopathy: Inhibits growth of enteric ammonia-producing bacteria to indirectly reduce serum ammonia level.

Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (off-label): Inhibits growth of enteric bacteria to reduce gas production.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Although in vitro studies demonstrated the potential of rifaximin to interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4), a clinical drug-drug interaction study demonstrated that rifaximin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. An additional clinical drug-drug interaction study showed no effect of rifaximin on the presystemic metabolism of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate. Therefore, clinical interactions with drugs metabolized by human cytochrome P450 isozymes are not expected.Indication: Ocular inflammation

Bipolar disorder: Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition.

Depression: Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition.

Diabetes: There is some concern that taking high doses of fish oil might make the control of blood sugar more difficult.

High blood pressure: Fish oil can lower blood pressure and might cause blood pressure to drop too low in people who are being treated with blood pressure-lowering medications.

HIV/AIDS and other conditions in which the immune system response is lowered: Higher doses of fish oil can lower the body’s immune system response. This could be a problem for people whose immune system is already weak.

Familial adenomatous polyposis: There is some concern that fish oil might further increase the risk of getting cancer in people with this condition.

Precaution: Liver disease: Fish oil might increase the risk of bleeding.

Contra-indication: Sertraline is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Sertraline or any of the excipients of drug.

Side effects: Sertraline may cause side effects like upset stomach, diarrhoea, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, loss of appetite, weight changes, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, pain, burning or tingling in the hands or feet, excitement, sore throat etc.

Precaution: Precaution should be taken in case of liver problems, kidney diseases, seizures, heart problems and any allergies. This drug may cause dizziness or drowsiness. Caution should be taken in activities requiring alertness such as driving or using machinery. Caution is advised while using this product in the elderly because they may be more sensitive to the effects of the drug. Do not take this drug if you have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitor in the last five weeks.

Mode of action: Sertraline has a potent and selective inhibitory action on CNS neuronal reuptake of 5-HT resulting in increased 5-HT concentrations at the synaptic clefts, leading to sustained activity at the postsynaptic receptor sites and improvement of depression. Reduction of serotonin turnover (in brain) also contributes to its action. Its long half-life allows once daily admin.

Pregnancy category: C

	Indication: Cuts, Wounds, Severe burns, Post-operative wound dressing, Bed sores

Dose: Adult: Topical As 1% cream: Apply onto affected area 1-2 times/day.

Burns: The burn wound should be cleaned and  cream applied over all the affected areas to a depth of 3-5mm.  Where necessary, the cream should be re-applied to any area from which it has been removed by patient activity. In burns,  cream should be re-applied at least every 24 hours or more frequently if the volume of exudate is large.

Hand burns: Before application of Sibalyn® cream to the burn, the whole hand should be enclosed in a clear plastic bag or glove . The patient should be encouraged to move the hand and fingers. The dressing should be changed when an excessive amount of exudate has accumulated in the bag.

Leg Ulcers/Pressure Sores: The cavity of the ulcer should be filled with  Cream to a depth of at least 3-5mm. As  Cream can cause maceration of normal skin on prolonged contact, care should be taken to prevent spread onto non-ulcerated areas. Application of Cream should be followed by an absorbent pad or gauze dressing, with further application of pressure bandaging as appropriate for the ulcer.The dressings should normally be changed daily but for wounds which are less exudative, less frequent changes (every 48 hours) may be acceptable. 

Contra-indication: Silver sulfadiazine cream is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitivity to silver sulphonamide or to other components of the preparation such as cetyl alcohol or propylene glycol. Because sulphonamide therapy is known to increase the possibility of kernicterus, silver sulphadiazine cream should not be used in pregnant women at term, in premature infants or in infants during the first months of life. It should not be used if hepatic and renal functions become impaired or if the condition of porphyria is suspected.

Side effects: The most common sides effects are allergic reactions including burning, itching and rashes; argyria reported following prolonged use. Transient leucopenia may occur in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy.

Precaution: Silver sulfadiazine cream should be used with caution in the presence of significant hepatic or renal impairment or if the condition of porphyria is suspected. Caution of use is required in patients known to be sensitive to systemic sulphonamides and in individuals known to have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and concomitant use with topical proteolytic enzymes. Use of silver sulfadiazine cream may delay separation of burn eschar and may alter the appearance of the burn wounds.

Mode of action: Silver sulfadiazine has broad antimicrobial activity; it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as some yeasts and fungi. The silver salt acts mainly on the cell wall and membrane to disrupt its intergrity thus allowing it to impair the essential enzymes, bacterial DNA and RNA leading to cell death.

	Indication: Snake Venom Antiserum  is  indicated  for  bites  caused  by  Cobra,  Common  Krait,  Russell's  Viper  and  Saw-Scaled 
Viper, where the patient presents with one or more of fallowing visible clinical signs and symptoms of 
envenomation – 

1. Local envenomation-
a) Presence of bite marks with or without oozing of blood, blistering and change in color of skin.
b) Rapidly progressive or massive swelling involving more than half of the bitten limb within few hours 
of bite (without tourniquet)
c) Development of enlarged tender lymph nodes draining the bitten part within couple of hours after 
bite

2. Systemic envenomation-
a) Neurotoxic syndrome- signs of neuro-paralysis like blurring of vision, double vision, and difficulty in 
swallowing, sleepy feeling, drooping of head, slurring of speech and the voice may become indistinct 
with shallow breathing, ptosis, ataxia, respiratory paralysis and generalized flaccid paralysis.

b)  Hemotoxic  syndrome-  spontaneous  systemic  bleeding,  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain  and 
abdominal tenderness suggestive of gastro-intestinal or retro-peritoneal bleed and/or renal damage, 
coagulopathy detected by 20 min WBCT with or without external bleeding and shock.

Dose: Initial dose depends upon an estimate of the amount of envenomation as mentioned below:
1. Minimal Envenomation -Progressive local swelling but no systemic symptoms.  5 vials (50ml) is recommended to be administered.
2. Moderate  Envenomation -Swelling  beyond  the  site  of  the  bite,  mild  systemic  symptoms,  and/or hematologic and coagulation abnormalities are present. 5 to 10 vials (50 to 100ml) is recommended to be administered.
3. Severe  Envenomation -Rapidly  progressive  and  extensive  local  effects,  systemic  symptoms  and evidence  of  hemolysis  or  coagulopathy.  10  to  20  vials  (100 -200ml)  or  more  is  recommended  to  be administered.

In  children  and  small  adults  (body  weight  less  than  40kg)  upto  50%  more  doses  of  Snake    Venom Antiserum is recommended to be administered.

ADMINISTRATION:
Snake Venom Antiserum is administered intravenously either  undiluted at the rate of not more than 1ml per  minute  or  is  diluted  in  500ml  of  intravenous  fluid  (either  Sodium  Chloride  Injection  or  5%  Dextrose Injection) and  administered  as  rapidly  as  tolerated  over  1-2  hours.  While diluting the Snake Venom Antiserum, mix by gentle swirling rather than shaking to avoid foaming.
Additional  infusions  should  be  repeated  hourly  until  progressive  swelling  in  the  bitten  part  ceases  and systemic  signs  and  symptoms  disappear.  When an adequate dosage is achieved, the improvement in patient's clinical signs are often seen.


Contra-indication: There are no known contraindications for the administration of Antivenom. Person who is proven to be allergic to equine antisera.

Side effects: a) The immediate reaction (shock & anaphylaxis) usually occurs within 30 minutes. Symptoms and signs may develop before the needle is withdrawn and include urticaria, itching, fever, chills or rigor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, tachycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema.

b)  Serum sickness usually occurs 5 to 24 days after administration.  The  usual symptoms  and  signs  are  fever,  urticaria,  edema,  nausea  and  vomiting.  Occasionally neurological manifestations develop. Pain and muscle weakness are frequently present.


Precaution: Proper  precautions  are  necessary  while  dealing  with  persons  with  a  known  hypersensitivity  to 
constituents of product. Few doctors prefer to premedicate patients with Inj. Adrenaline 0.25 ml s/c to 
prevent  possibility  of  adverse  reactions.  In  haemotoxic  bites,  IM  injections  should  be  avoided  till 
correction of coagulopathy to avoid formation of haematoma and oozing of blood.

Not for local administration on bitten area.

In   patients   having   tourniquet,   it   should   be   released   slowly   only   after   start   of  Antivenom 
administration.

Mode of action: Passive immunization, antivenoms are in- jected to neutralize snake venoms in the patient’s blood circulation.

Oral Liquid: Adults and Children >12 years: Take 10-20 mL (two to four 5 mL spoonfuls). Children 6-12 years: Take 5-10 mL (one to two 5 mL spoonfuls). Administered after meals and at bedtime.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity

Side effects: Gastrointestinal

Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported the most frequently. These have included constipation (secondary to aluminum hydroxide therapy) and diarrhea (secondary to magnesium carbonate therapy). 

Patients with renal failure may be at risk of aluminum toxicity because of ingestion of aluminum hydroxide and because of exposure to aluminum-containing water used for dialysate solutions. Adverse effects of aluminum accumulation in these patients has led to monitoring of water source aluminum content by dialysis units and periodic measurements of serum aluminum in patients undergoing chronic dialysis.

Concurrent administration of aluminum hydroxide with citrate containing products has been associated with unusually high serum concentrations of aluminum and, especially in cases of renal failure, severe toxicity. Citrate may increase aluminum solubility and absorption.

During long-term use, aluminum has been shown to deposit in bone, joint, and brain.

Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia may include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, EKG changes, respiratory depression, loss of deep tendon reflex, dilated pupils, altered mental status, and coma.

Metabolic

Metabolic side effects have included hypophosphatemia with the use of aluminum hydroxide. In patients on long-term aluminum hydroxide therapy, especially in association with poor diets, hypophosphatemia may result in muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, hemolysis, and encephalopathy.

Osteomalacia due to aluminum deposition in bone is generally only seen in patients with chronic renal failure. Bone formation slows in response to aluminum bone deposits. Aluminum may also deposit in joint tissue, resulting in arthropathy and hydrarthrosis.

Musculoskeletal side effects have included osteomalacia, due to aluminum hydroxide, which may occur by two different mechanisms. Osteomalacia may occur due to hypophosphatemia or due to aluminum accumulation in bone. Osteomalacia due to hypophosphatemia is often accompanied by malaise, bone pain, muscular weakness, and bone fractures. Osteomalacia due to aluminum deposition may present in a similar fashion and occurs predominately in patients with chronic renal failure. Aluminum deposits typically can be observed on bone biopsy.
Nervous system

Encephalopathy associated with aluminum accumulation is characterized by speech disorders, dysarthria, dyspraxia, dysphasia, tremor, myoclonus, seizures, coma, and ultimately death. EEG of patients with aluminum encephalopathy may show paroxysmal slowing and diffuse rhythmical bursts of delta activity.
Renal

Renal side effects have rarely included formation of renal calculi, most probably due to hypercalciuria, with the use of aluminum hydroxide.


Precaution: Magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide and alginic acid have not been formally assigned to a pregnancy category by the FDA. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy.  Magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide and alginic acid should only be given in pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.

Mode of action: Alginic acid is used in combination with an antacid or histamine H2-antagonist in the management of gastro-esophageal reflux disease. It reacts with gastric acid to form a viscous gel which acts as a mechanical barrier to reduce reflux.

Adult: As a 2% ointment/cream/gel: Apply onto affected area 3-4 times daily until there is improvement. If gauze dressing is used, then frequency of application may be reduced to 1-2 times daily.
Child: As a 2% ointment/cream/gel: Apply onto affected area 3-4 times daily until there is improvement. If gauze dressing is used, then frequency of application may be reduced to 1-2 times daily.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to fusidic acid.

Side effects: Fucidin given orally may cause gastrointestinal disturbances (dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting) which can normally be avoided by giving Fucidin with meals. Reversible increase of transaminases is reported at daily dosages of 1.5-3 g of Fucidin tablets. Reversible jaundice has been reported in some patients after administration of systemic Fucidin, most frequently in patients receiving IV Fucidin in high dosage and especially in serious Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. In some cases, instituting oral therapy may be beneficial. If the jaundice persists, Fucidin should be withdrawn, after which the serum bilirubin will return to normal. Allergic reactions are reported in very few cases.

Precaution: As fusidic acid is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through the bile, periodic liver function tests should be carried out in patients with liver dysfunction, abnormalities in the biliary pathway, when fusidic acid is given in high doses for prolonged periods, or when it is given in combination with other antibiotics which have similar excretion pathways eg, lincomycin and rifampicin. In vitro, fusidic acid displaces bilirubin from its albumin-binding site. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain and kernicterus has not been observed in neonates receiving systemic Fucidin. However, this observation should be borne in mind when fusidic acid is given to preterm, jaundiced, acidotic or seriously ill neonates.
Use in pregnancy & lactation: Animal studies and many years of clinical experience have suggested that Fucidin is devoid of teratogenic effects. Fusidic acid passes the placenta and should be avoided during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy due to the theoretical risk of kernicterus.
Concentrations of fusidic acid found in breast milk are negligible and its use is not contraindicated in nursing mothers.

Mode of action: Fusidic acid disrupts translocation of peptide subunits and elongating the peptide chain of susceptible bacteria, thus inhibiting protein synthesis.

Dose: Prolong release formulation of sodium Valproate may be given once or twice daily.  

Epilepsy: Adults -Initially 600 mg daily given in 2 divided doses, preferably after food, increasing by 200 mg/day at 3-day intervals to a maximum of 2.5 g daily in divided doses until control of seizure is achieved. Usual maintenance dose is 1-2 g daily (20-30 mg/kg daily).  

Children Initially 20 mg/kg daily in divided doses, may be increased (up to 20 kg) provided plasma concentrations monitored (above 40 mg/kg daily also monitor clinical chemistry and hematological parameters). 

Children Initially 400 mg daily in divided doses increased until control (0ver 20 kg) (usually in the range of 20-30 mg/kg daily); Maximum 35 mg/kg daily. 

Febrile convulsion20-30 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses.  

Bipolar disorder initially 20-30 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses; adjust dosage in 3-5 days. Maintenance dosage is 1000-2000 mg/day. 

Prophylaxis of migraine 300 mg twice daily, although some may require 1000 mg daily.

Hepatic impairment: Contraindicated.

Contra-indication: Sodium Valproate is contraindicated to patients who have known hypersensitivity to the drug and liver dysfunction. Care should be exercised when prescribing Sodium Valproate in women of child bearing age.

Side effects: The most common side effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. However, these side effects are minimized with the use of enteric coated tablets. Effects on the CNS include sedation, ataxia and tremor. These symptoms occur infrequently and usually respond to a decrease in doses. Rash, alopecia and stimulation of appetite have been observed occasionally. Sodium Valproate has several effects on hepatic function of which elevation of liver enzymes in plasma is observed in up to 40% of patients and often occurs asymptomatically during the first few months of therapy. Rarely a fulminate hepatitis that may be fatal may develop. Children below 2 years of age with other medical conditions and those being treated with multiple antiepileptic agents are specially prone to suffer from hepatic injury, acute pancreatitis and hyperammonemia have also been frequently associated with the use of Sodium Valproate.

Precaution: Liver functions should be monitored before therapy and during first 6 months especially in patients most at risk, No undue potential for bleeding before starting and before major surgery must be ensured, Care should be taken in renal impairment, pregnancy, breast-feeding and systemic lupus erythematosus. Sodium Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a ketone metabolite, which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test. Sudden withdrawal of therapy should be avoided. 

Mode of action: Valproate is a generic term used to describe valproic acid, its salts and derivatives. It is available in various forms including the sodium salts (valproate semisodium and sodium valproate), the amide derivative (valpromide), or as valproic acid. Valproate is a carboxylic acid anticonvulsant. It has been suggested that its antiepileptic activity is related to increased brain levels of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Total solution volume 90 ml, Infusion rate: Infuse 30 ml/hour for 30 min. Maintenance: 100,000 u/hr for 24-72 hr depending on the condition treated. Duration for cerebral retinal thrombosis: 12 hr. Maintain thrombin clotting time at 2-4 times normal values. 

Child: Loading dose: 2500-4000 units/kg over 30 min, followed by infusion of 500-1000 units/kg/hr, continued until reperfusion occurs, up to 3 days. Initial dose may be estimated by streptokinase resistance test. Monitor treatment by maintaining thrombin clotting time at 2-4 times normal values.



Contra-indication: Severe hypertension, recent stroke, cerebral neoplasm, recent history of peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, coagulation defects also due to liver or kidney disease, recent surgery, childbirth. Hypersensitivity, increased risk of cerebral bleeding, trauma. Pregnancy. Active internal bleeding, bleeding GI lesions. Arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm; recent (within 10 days) facial or head trauma, intracranial or intraspinal surgery, More than 5 days and less than 12 months since previous Streptokinase therapy.

Side effects: Headache and back pain, muscle pain (including myalgia), chills and/or fever as well as asthenia/malaise. Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleedings (including aggravation of menstrual bleeding), epistaxis. Development of antistreptokinase antibodies. Hypotension, heart rate and rhythm disorders, angina pectoris. Recurrent ischaemia, heart failure, reinfarction, cardiogenic shock, pericarditis, pulmonary oedema. Nausea, diarrhoea, epigastric pain and vomiting. Arrhythmia, bruising, rash, pruritus, acute renal failure due to embolism and haemorrhage. Cerebral, peripheral and pulmonary embolism. Allergic reactions, liver enzyme abnormalities, hypotension. Potentially Fatal: Haemorrhage; anaphylactic shock.

Precaution: Mitral stenosis associated with AF. Streptokinase treatment within last 12 mth, use after prolonged or traumatic CPR; diabetic retinopathy. Elderly. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, due to antistreptokinase antibodies, retreatment with Streptokinase or Streptokinase-containing products may not be effective if administered between five days and twelve months of prior Streptokinase administration or Streptococcal infections, such as Streptococcal pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis secondary to a Streptococcal infection. In principle, no thrombolytic treatment should be commenced before the 10th postoperative day. However, in cases of pulmonary embolism, the indication for earlier treatment may be very strong and after careful consideration of all the risks, Streptokinase may be given before the tenth postoperative day. The danger of bleeding from the operative area must, of course, be taken into account. The danger of haemorrhage is increased by simultaneous or previous treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., Heparin) or substances which inhibit platelet formation or function. If the patient is under active heparinisation, it should be neutralised by the administration of protamine sulphate before the start of thrombolytic therapy.  Repeated Administration After administration of Streptokinase, the titre of antistreptokinase antibodies begins to rise after approximately one week, reaching a peak at 2 to 3 weeks and remains elevated for 8 to 12 months. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, Streptokinase may not be effective if given during this period.

Mode of action: Streptokinase forms a complex with plasminogen which then converts plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin breaks down clots as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Antagonistic effects with antifibrinolytic agents e.g. aminocaproic acid.
Potentially Fatal: Anticoagulants, heparin, antiplatelet agents e.g. aspirin and dipyridamole affect platelet function increasing the risk of haemorrhage.Renata	Streptomycin Injection 1gm/vial 1gm vial 9.19 BDT

Precaution: Renal or hepatic impairment; history of allergy or asthma; AIDS; G6PD deficiency; elderly; ensure adequate fluid intake to reduce risk of crystalluria.

Mode of action: Sulfadimidine is a short-acting sulfonamide. It interferes with the synthesis of nucleic acids in sensitive organisms by blocking the conversion of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to the co-enzyme dihydrofolic acid. Its action is bacteriostatic, although it exerts bactericidal effects where concentrations of thymine are low in the surrounding medium. It has been used with other sulfonamides, e.g. sulfamerazine and sulfadiazine. In veterinary medicine, it is sometimes used with baquiloprim or trimethoprim. Sulfadimidine is used to determine acetylator status due to its pharmacokinetic differences in fast and slow acetylators.

Contra-indication: Sensitivity to salicylic acid and sulphar.

Side effects: Skin irritation. Redness and peeling of skin may occur after a few days.

Precaution: Pregnancy/Reproduction, Breast-feeding, young children may be at increased risk of toxicity because of increased absorption of salicylic acid through the skin.Salicylic acid should not be applied to large areas of the body, for prolonged periods of time.
Elderly patients are more likely to have age-related peripheral vascular disease and, therefore, may be more prone to acute inflammation or ulceration of the extremities. 
Avoiding contact with the eyes. Washing hands immediately after application to remove any medication. Avoiding concurrent use with topical mercury-containing preparations.

Mode of action: Keratolytic agent; breaks down keratin and promotes skin peeling. Salicylic acid has a potent keratolytic action and a slight antiseptic action when applied topically. It softens and destroys the stratum corneum by increasing endogenous hydration which causes the horny layer of the skin to swell, soften, and then desquamate. At high concentrations, salicylic acid has a caustic effect. It also possesses weak antifungal and antibacterial activity.

	Indication: Atopic dermatitis, Allergic contact dermatitis, Severe eczema, Psoriasis, Alopecia areata, Pyoderma gangrenosum, Cutaneous lupus erythematosus, Dermatomyositis, Seborrheic dermatitis, Rosacea, Lichen Planus, Pemphigus Vulgaris, Vitiligo, Graft-Versus-Host Disease, Ichthyosis.

Dose: Apply a thin layer of Tacrolim ointment onto the affected skin areas twice daily and rub in gently and completely. Treatment should be continued for one week after clearing of signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. The safety of Tacrolim ointment under occlusion which may promote systemic exposure has not been evaluated. Tacrolim ointment should not be used with occlusive dressings. 

Contra-indication: Tacrolimus ointment is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to Tacrolimus or any other component of the preparation.

Side effects: Topically applied Tacrolimus ointment have very few and rare type of side-effects including skin burning, pruritus, flu-like symptoms, allergic reactions, skin erythema, skin infections, headache, etc.

Precaution: Cautions should be exercised while treatment with Tacrolimus ointment in patients with atopic dermatitis predisposed to superficial skin infections. The safety of Tacrolimus ointment has not been established in patients with generalized erythroderma.

Mode of action: Tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation, although the exact mechanism of action unclear. Tacrolimus bind to cytosolic receptors known as immunophilins (i.e., cyclophilin and FK binding protein-12 [FKBP-12], respectively), forming complexes that inhibit the production of cytokines via the calcineurin pathway. Inhibition of calcineurin activity inhibits early activation of T-cells (ie.immunosuppresion results).

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased nephrotoxicity with ciclosporin, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, NSAIDs, vancomycin, co-trimoxazole, aciclovir, ganciclovir. Increased risk of hyperkalemia with potassium-sparing diuretics. Increased plasma concentrations and toxicity with azole antifungals, calcium-channel blockers, cimetidine, danazol, HIV-protease inhibitors, macrolide antibacterials and metoclopramide. Antacids, rifampin, rifabutin, casofungin, phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine decrease tacrolimus plasma concentrations. Concurrent admin of sirolimus and tacrolimus decrease levels of both.ACI	Ciaton TAB dr 10mg 4's pack 140.44 BDT

	Indication: Benign prostatic hyperplasia

Dose: Oral
Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Adult: Per tab contains tamsulosin 0.4 mg and dutasteride 0.5 mg: 1 tab once daily.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity, severe liver impairment. Pregnancy, lactation, child, adolescent.

Side effects: Impotence, decreased libido, ejaculation disorders, breast tenderness and enlargement, postural hypotension, dizziness and vertigo, headache, infection, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, somnolence, insomnia, rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough, sinusitis, diarrhoea, nausea, tooth disorder, blurred vision.

Precaution: Excreted in semen therefore use of condom is recommended. Women of childbearing potential should avoid handling leaking capsules of dutasteride. Prostate carcinoma should be ruled out before starting the therapy. Blood donation to be avoided during and at least 6 mths after discontinuance of drug.

Mode of action: Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker. It blocks alpha-1 adrenoceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck, resulting relaxation of these adrenoceptors in the bladder neck and prostate. Thus, there is an improvement in urine flow rate and reduction in symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Dutasteride inhibits 5 alpha-reductase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Concomitant admin with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (eg. fluoxetine) or CYP34A (eg. ketoconazole, cimetidine) increases tamsulosin serum concentration; increase in blood concentrations of dutasteride in the presence of inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, verapamil, diltiazem, cimetidine, troleandomycin, and ciprofloxacin.ACI	Sasolin CAP 400mcg 16's pack 161.12 BDT

	Indication: Benign prostatic hyperplasia

Dose: Oral
Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Adult: As HCl: As modified-release preparation: 1 (one) capsule once daily is recommended as the dose for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH. It should be administered approximately one-half hour following the same meal each day. 

For those patients who fail to respond to the 0.4 mg dose after two to four weeks of dosing, the dose of capsules can be increased to 0.8 mg once daily. 

If capsules administration is discontinued or interrupted for several days at either the 0.4 mg or 0.8 mg dose, therapy should be started again with the 0.4 mg once daily dose.

Renal impairment:
CrCl (ml/min)	
>10	No dose adjustment needed.
<10	        Not studied.

Hepatic impairment: Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification A and B): No dose adjustment needed. Severe hepatic impairment: Avoid.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to sulfonamide, severe hepatic impairment, lactation.

Side effects: The following adverse reactions have been reported during the use of Tamsulosin: dizziness, abnormal ejaculation, and less frequently (1-2%) headache, asthenia, postural hypotension, palpitations and rhinitis. Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation can occasionally occur. Hypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, and urticaria can occur occasionally. As with other alpha-blockers, drowsiness, blurred vision, dry mouth or oedema can occur. Syncope has been reported rarely, and there have been very rare reports of angioedema and priapism.

Precaution: Hypersensitivity to Tamsulosin Hydrochloride. A history of orthostatic hypotension; severe hepatic insufficiency. As with other alpha1 blockers, a reduction in blood pressure can occur in individual cases during treatment with Tamsulosin, as a result of which, rarely, syncope can occur. At the first signs of orthostatic hypotension (dizziness, weakness) the patient should sit or lie down until the symptoms have disappeared. And they should be cautioned to avoid situations where injury could result (like driving, operating machinery or performing hazardous tasks). Before therapy with Tamsulosin is initiated the patient should be examined in order to exclude the presence of other conditions which can cause the same symptoms as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Digital rectal examination and when necessary determination of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) should be performed before treatment and at regular intervals afterwards. The treatment of severely renal impaired patients (creatinine clearance is less than10ml/min) should be approached with caution as these patients have not been studied. Caution should be exercised in porphyria or allergic reaction to this or any other medicine.

Mode of action: Tamsulosin is a selective ?1 adrenoreceptor-blocking agent. Smooth muscle tone is mediated by the sympathetic nervous stimulation of ?1 adrenoreceptors, which are abundant in the prostate, prostatic capsule, prostatic urethra, and bladder neck. Blockade of these adrenoceptors can cause smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to relax, resulting in an improvement in urine flow rate and reduction in symptoms in BPH.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Increased plasma concentration w/ strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole). Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin), strong (e.g. paroxetine) or moderate (e.g. terbinafine) CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase exposure of tamsulosin. Increased plasma concentration w/ cimetidine. Additive effect w/ other ?-adrenergic blocking agents. Concomitant use w/ PDE5 inhibitors may lead to symptomatic hypotension. Decreased plasma concentration w/ furosemide.ACI	Lopenta TAB dr 50mg   BDT

Precaution: Opioid REMS

    FDA now requires risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for extended-release (ER) and long-acting (LA) opioid analgesics
    REMS strongly encourages prescribers to complete REMS-compliant education program and to counsel patients regarding safe use, risks, storage, and disposal of ER/LA opioids

Limitations of use

    ER/LA opioids are intended only for management of moderate-to-severe pain when continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for extended period
    ER/LA opioids are not intended for PRN use, acute pain, or postoperative pain (unless patient is already receiving long-term opioid therapy before surgery or postoperative pain is expected to persist for extended period

Abuse potential

    Druig is controlled substance with abuse potential; assess patient’s risk for opioid abuse or addiction (including alcohol) before prescribing
    Assess mental illness (eg, major depressive disorder)
    Routinely monitor for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction during treatment

Life-threatening respiratory depression

    Respiratory depression, including fatal cases, may occur even when drug is used at recommended doses without misuse or abuse; proper dosing titration is essential and should be prescribed by healthcare providers knowledgeable in use of opioids and pain relief
    Follow administration instructions for ER/LA opioids regarding swallowing whole (ie, do not chew, crush, or dissolve tablet) to avoid too-rapid release and absorption of potentially fatal dose

Accidental exposure

    Accidental ingestion, especially in children, can result in fatal overdose of opioid analgesic

Alcohol interaction

    Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use alcohol-containing drug products while taking morphine
    Coingestion of alcohol with opioid analgesics may increase plasma opioid levels and potentially result in fatal overdose


Mode of action: Mu-opioid agonist; inhibits ascending pain pathways, thus altering response to pain; produces analgesia, respiratory depression, and sedation; also inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine, which also affects ascending pain pathways.

Pregnancy category: C

	Indication: Acne, Stable plaque psoriasis, Photo aging

Dose: For psoriasis: Apply once daily in the evening usually for up to twelve weeks. Use and dose must be determined by the doctor of children upto 12 years of age.
For acne: Cleanse the face gently. After the skin is dry, apply a thin layer of Tazarotene cream once per day, in the evening, to the skin areas where acne lesions appear. Use enough to cover the entire affeted area. 

Contra-indication: It is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any ingredients of Tazarotene cream.

Side effects: Generally Tazarotene cream is well-tolerated .The most frequent adverse events related to treatment with Tazarotene are skin-related as for example pruritus, erythema, burning, irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema.

Precaution: Tazarotene cream should be applied only to the affected areas. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, and mouth. If contact with eyes occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.
Retinoid should not be used on eczematous skin, as they may cause severe irritation.
Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of Tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity.

Mode of action: Tazarotene is a synthetic acetylenic retinoid, that is applied topically. It is de-esterified in the skin to its active form, tazarotenic acid, which affects cell proliferation and differentiation by modulating gene expression in acne and psoriasis.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Increased drying effect effect with concomitant use of dermatologic medications and cosmetics that have irritant or strong drying effect. Increased risk of photosensitivity with drugs known to be photosensitisers.Eskayef Bangladesh Ltd.	Tibs TAB dr 6mg 50's pack 300 BDT

Mode of action: Tegaserod is a 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist that binds with high affinity at human 5-HT4 receptors, whereas it has no appreciable affinity for 5-HT3 or dopamine receptors. It has moderate affinity for 5-HT1 receptors. Tegaserod, by acting as an agonist at neuronal 5-HT4 receptors, triggers the release of further neurotransmitters such as calcitonin gene-related peptide from sensory neurons. The activation of 5-HT4 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract stimulates the peristaltic reflex and intestinal secretion, as well as inhibits visceral sensitivity.

CSL Behring GmbH, Germany	Human Anti-tetanus Immuno Globulin Injection 250 IU  1200 BDT
	Indication: Passive immunisation against Tetanus

Dose: Adults and children 7 years and older: 250 units(1 ml) should be given by deep intramuscular injection . 
At the same time, but in a different extremity and with a separate syringe, active immunization with adsorved tetanus vaccine should be administered. 

Children less than 7 years old: In small children the routine prophylactic dose  may be calculated by the body weight (4.0 units/kg). 

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity homologous Ig-containing medicinal products particularly in patients w/ IgA deficiency & concurrent presence of Ab to IgA.

Side effects: Slight soreness at the site of injection and slight temperature elevation may be noted at times. Sensitization to repeated injections of human immunoglobulin is extremely rare.

In the course of routine injections of large numbers of persons with immunoglobulin there have been a few isolated occurrences of angioneurotic edema, nephrotic syndrome, and anaphylactic shock after injection.

Precaution: Intravenous injection of immunoglobulin intended for intramuscular use can, on occasion, cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure, and a picture not unlike anaphylaxis. Injections should only be made intramuscularly and care should be taken to draw back on the plunger of the syringe before injection in order to be certain that the needle is not in a blood vessel. Intramuscular injections are preferably administered in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal region should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.

Chemoprophylaxis against tetanus is neither practical nor useful in managing wounds. Wound cleaning, debridement when indicated, and proper immunization are important. The need for tetanus toxoid (active immunization), with or without TIG (passive immunization), depends on both the condition of the wound and the patient’s vaccination history. Rarely has tetanus occurred among persons with documentation of having received a primary series of toxoid injections.

Mode of action: Tetanus immunoglobulin is used for passive immunisation against tetanus.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: May reduce the efficacy of live vaccines.Incepta	Vaxitet-IG Injection 3000 IU/ml 1's pack 408 BDT
	
Fisons, UK	Tetabulin Injection  10's amps pack 7500 BDT
	Indication: Immediate protection against Tetanus

Dose: Prophylaxis of tetanus: Tetanus Antitoxin (equine) should not be used in the routine treatment of traumatic wounds. It is given prophylactically to persons at the risk of tetanus infection by infected wounds or severe wounds. 

For prophylaxis after injury, non-immune or partially immune persons may be given 3,000 to 5,000 units of tetanus antitoxin subcutaneously or intramuscularly. If 24 hours have passed since the wound occurred, the dose is 3,000 IU. 

In crush wounds or wounds contaminated with soil or other foreign bodies, the dose is 10,000 to 20,000 IU. For persons below 30 kg the dosage is 1,500 IU. 

Active immunization with Adsorbed Tetanus vaccine should be given simultaneously with the use of this preparation or a booster injection of Adsorbed Tetanus vaccine should be given if the patient has previously been immunized. 

Treatment: Therapy should be given as soon as possible after the appearance of symptoms of the disease. Therapeutic dose not less than 3000 IU. Depending on the severity, the dose may vary from 50,000 to 100,000 IU of tetanus antitoxin for hospitalized patients given partially by intravenous route and the rest of the dose intramuscularly.



Contra-indication: Should be used with great caution if patient is subject to allergic disease such as asthma or infantile eczema, or was allergic to any previous antiserum injection.


Side effects: Reactions are liable to occur after the injection of any serum of animal origin. Anaphylaxis may occur in rare cases, with hypotension, dyspnoea, urticaria, and shock. Anaphylactic reactions should be treated with adrenalin, possibly in association with antihistamine and corticosteroid therapy. Serum sickness may occur 7 to 10 days after injection of serum of animal origin; symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, bronchospasm, and urticaria; nephritis, myocarditis, neuritis, polyarthritis, and uveitis have been reported as rare complications of serum sickness.


Precaution: If there is no history of previous serum injection or allergic reaction, the dose of serum may be given intramuscularly. If the patient is subject to allergic diseases, a trial dose of 0,2 mL (diluted 1:10 if preferred) of the serum should be given subcutaneously; if no general reaction develops during an interval of 30 minutes, the main dose may be given intramuscularly. The patient must be kept under observation for at least 30 minutes after the injection and adrenaline kept in readiness for emergency use. In all urgent cases, the intravenous route is indicated, but should never be used unless a preliminary intramuscular injection, given at least 30 minutes beforehand, has been tolerated. For intravenous use, the serum should be at room temperature, the injection should be given very slowly, and the patient should be recumbent during the injection, and for at least an hour afterwards.


Mode of action: Tetanus toxoid induces active immunity to the tetanus antigen by stimulating the immune system to produce specific antitoxin. They are not indicated for the treatment of active tetanus infection.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction: Decreased immunologic response with concurrent immunosuppressants. Neutralisation of tetanus immune globulin and tetanus toxoid adsorbed if not given at different sites using different syringes.Incepta	Vaxitet Injection  40 i.u / 0.5ml 1's pack/10 ampoule pack 80/600 BDT

	Indication: Active immunisation against tetanus, Postexposure prophylaxis of tetanus

Dose: Primary immunization for persons 7 years of age and older: A series of three doses of 0.5 ml each, of adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be given intramuscularly; First dose: At appropriate date, Second dose: 4 to 8 weeks after the first dose, Third dose: 6 to 12 months after the second dose.

Children older than 7 years who did not complete primary immunization series (e.g., previously received only two doses of DTaP or DTP) need to receive only one dose of tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine to complete the primary series of tetanus.
Interruption of the recommended schedule with a delay between doses does not interfere with the final immunity achieved with adsorbed tetanus vaccine. There is no need to start the series over again, regardless of the time elapsed between doses.

Routine booster injections: To maintain adequate protection, a booster dose of 0.5 ml of adsorbed tetanus vaccine every 10 years thereafter is recommended.

Vaccination of injured persons:
Clean and minor wound: 
•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, no need of additional vaccine.
•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.

All other dirty wounds (contaminated with feces, soil, and saliva): 
•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.
•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml along with tetanus immunoglobulin required.

If a person has no previous vaccination or uncertain, the primary series of 3 doses of 0.5ml adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be given along with tetanus immunoglobulin with 1st dose.
Protection of neonatal tetanus
For prevention of neonatal tetanus, adsorbed tetanus vaccine is recommended for immunization of women of childbearing age.
 
For pregnant woman who have not had previous immunization, 2 doses of tetanus toxoid at four weeks interval preferably during the last two trimester or at least 2 weeks before delivery should be given during pregnancy so that protective antibody would be transferred to the infant in order to prevent neonatal tetanus. e.g. 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 6th month of pregnancy and 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 7th month of pregnancy.

Pregnant woman who have completed the course of tetanus, next 10 years no need of additional dose during pregnancy. Thereafter a single booster dose would be sufficient to extend immunity.


Contra-indication: It is a contraindication to use this or any other related vaccine after a serious adverse event temporally associated with a previous dose including an anaphylactic reaction. A history of systemic allergic or neurologic reactions following a previous dose of Tetanus Toxoid is an absolute contraindication for further use. 

If a contraindication to using tetanus toxoid -containing preparations exists in a person who has not completed a primary immunizing course of tetanus toxoid and other than a clean, minor wound is sustained; only passive immunization should be given using TIG (Human). 

Elective immunization should be deferred during the course of any febrile illness or acute infection. A minor afebrile illness such as a mild upper respiratory infection should not preclude immunization. Elective immunization procedures should be deferred during an outbreak of poliomyelitis. 


Side effects: Mild inj site reactions eg transient swelling, rash, fever, malaise, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, pruritus, dizziness.Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions. 

Precaution: Do not administer IV. Use subcutaneous route in bleeding disorders. Withhold vaccination in moderate or severe febrile illness. Pregnancy, lactation, history of Guillian-Barre syndrome.

Mode of action: Tetanus toxoid adsorbed induces active immunity to the tetanus antigen by stimulating the immune system to produce specific antitoxin. They are not indicated for the treatment of active tetanus infection.

 After the initial loading dose of Aspirin (usually 325 mg), use Ticagrelor with a daily maintenance dose of Aspirin should be of 75-100 mg. 

ACS patients who have received a loading dose of Clopidogrel, may be started on Ticagrelor. Ticagrelor can be administered with or without food. A patient who misses a dose of Ticagrelor should take one 90 mg tablet (next dose) at its scheduled time.

Contra-indication: History of Intracranial Hemorrhage: Ticagrelor is not recommended in patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) due to a high risk of recurrent ICH in this population.

Active Bleeding: Patients with active pathological bleeding eg, peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage.

Severe Hepatic Impairment: Patients with severe hepatic impairment because of a probable increase in exposure, and it has not been studied in these patients. Severe hepatic impairment increases the risk of bleeding because of reduced synthesis of coagulation proteins. 

Hypersensitivity (eg, angioedema) to ticagrelor or to any of the components.

Side effects: Bleeding, Dyspnea, Other side effects (Headache, back pain, nausea, dizziness, cough, hypotension, fatigue, Atrial fibrillation). 

Precaution: General Risk of Bleeding: Drugs that inhibit platelet function including Ticagrelor increase the risk of bleeding. 
Concomitant Aspirin Maintenance Dose: Use of Ticagrelor with maintenance doses of aspirin above 100 mg decreased the effectiveness of Ticagrelor. Therefore, after the initial loading dose of aspirin (usually 325 mg), use Ticagrelor with a maintenance dose of aspirin of 75-100 mg. 

Moderate Hepatic Impairment: Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 

Discontinuation of Ticagrelor: Discontinuation of Ticagrelor will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and death. 

Mode of action: Ticagrelor and its major metabolite reversibly interact with the platelet P2Y12 ADP-receptor to prevent signal transduction and platelet activation. Ticagrelor and its active metabolite are approximately equipotent.

	Indication: Skin and Skin structure Infections: Intra-Abdominal Infections: Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia

Dose: The duration of therapy should be guided by the severity and site of the infection and the patient's clinical and bacteriological progress. The recommended duration of treatment with Tigecycline for complicated skin and skin structure infections or for complicated intra-abdominal infections is 5 to 14 days and for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia is 7 to 14 days. The recommended daily dose is as follows:

Adults: The recommended dosage regimen for Tigecycline is an initial dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg every 12 hours. Intravenous (IV) infusions of Tigecycline should be administered over approximately 30 to 60 minutes every 12 hours.

Pediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.

Geriatric use: No unexpected overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.


Contra-indication: Tigecycline is contraindicated for use in patients who have known hypersensitivity to Tigecycline.

Side effects: The most common treatment-emergent adverse events are nausea and vomiting which generally occurre during the first 1-2 days of therapy. The following drug-related adverse events are reported infrequently in patients receiving Tigecycline:
Injection site inflammation & pain, septic shock, allergic reaction, chills, thrombophlebitis, bradycardia, tachycardia, vasodilatation, anorexia, dry mouth, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, prolonged prothrombin time, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis, leukorrhea.

Precaution: Tigecycline is structurally similar to Tetracycline-class antibiotics and should be administered with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to Tetracycline-class antibiotics.


Mode of action: A glycylcycline antibiotic that is structurally similar to tetracycline antibiotics; inhibits bacterial protein translation by binding to 30S ribosomal subunit, and blocks entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules in ribosome A site.

Dose: Ophth Open-angle glaucoma; Ocular HTN As eye drop soln: Initial: Instill 1 drop of 0.25% soln to affected eye(s) twice daily, increase to 1 drop of 0.5% soln twice daily if needed. Reduce to 1 drop/day if controlled. 

Contra-indication: Present or history of bronchial asthma, severe COPD, sinus bradycardia, 2nd and 3rd degree heart block, sick sinus syndrome, overt heart failure, cardiogenic shock, severe peripheral vascular disease/Raynaud's disease), Prinzmetal angina, untreated pheochromocytoma, metabolic acidosis, hypotension.

Side effects: Ophthalmic use: Burning, stinging, blurred vision, ocular irritation (e.g. conjunctivitis, blepharitis, crusting), decreased corneal sensitivity, visual disturbances, diplopia, ptosis, cystoid macular oedema, pseudopemphigoid, choroidal detachment following filtration surgery. Adverse reactions associated with systemic administration of beta-blocker may occur with ophthalmic use. Potentially Fatal: Heart failure, intensification of heart block, bronchospasm, respiratory failure.

Precaution: Due to systemic absorption of ophthalmic preparations, adverse reactions associated with systemic administration of beta-blockers may occur. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blocker may cause exacerbation of angina, and myocardial infarctions have occurred in some cases. Ophthalmic Timolol should not be used alone for treatment of angle-closure glaucoma. beta-blocker therapy may increase sensitivity towards allergen in patients with history of atrophy or severe anaphylaxis reactions. Safety and efficacy have not been established in paediatric patients.

Mode of action: Exact mechanism of ocular hypotensive effect is unclear, but it is thought to be related to reduction of aqueous humour formation. beta-blockade also causes lowering of BP.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Concomitant admin w/ reserpine may increase hypotension and bradycardia. Additive effects w/ other antihypertensives (e.g. hydralazine, methyldopa).

Dose: Use in adults:
The dose is one drop of  in the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) once daily, in the morning or evening. It should be administered at the same time each day.

Paediatric patients:
The efficacy and safety of Travast Plus in patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to Travoprost, Timolol or to any of the excipients. 

Side effects: No serious ophthalmic or systemic undesirable effects  were reported. The most frequently reported treatment-related undesirable effect was ocular hyperaemia. Other common side-effects may be keratitis, anterior chamber flare, eye pain, photophobia, eye swelling, conjunctival haemorrhage, corneal staining, ocular discomfort, visual acuity reduced, visual disturbance, blurred vision etc.

Precaution: Like other topically applied ophthalmic agents, Travoprost and Timolol are absorbed systemically. Due to the beta-adrenergic component, timolol, the same types of cardiovascular and pulmonary adverse reactions as seen with systemic beta adrenergic blocking agents may occur. 

Mode of action: Exact mechanism of ocular hypotensive effect is unclear, but it is thought to be related to reduction of aqueous humour formation. ?-blockade also causes lowering of BP.

Travoprost, a prodrug and synthetic analogue of dinoprost (prostaglandin F2?), reduces intraocular pressure by increasing uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humour.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Interactions with Other Medications and Other Forms of Interaction: Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of MTX, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance.

Tocilizumab has not been studied in combination with other biological DMARDs.

The expression of hepatic CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by cytokines, eg, IL-6, that stimulate chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 expression may be reversed when potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, eg, tocilizumab is introduced.

In vitro studies with cultured human hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme expression. Tocilizumab normalizes expression of these enzymes.

The effect of tocilizumab on CYP enzymes (except CYP2C19 and CYP2D6) is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, and/or where the dose is individually adjusted.

In a study in RA patients, levels of simvastatin (CYP3A4) were decreased by 57% one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, to the level similar or slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects.

When starting or stopping therapy with tocilizumab, patients taking medications, which are individually dose-adjusted and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 1A2, or 2C9 (eg, atorvastatin, calcium channel blockers, theophylline, warfarin, phenytoin, ciclosporin, or benzodiazepines) should be monitored as doses of these products may need to be adjusted to maintain their therapeutic effect. Given its long elimination t½, the effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.ACI	Namitol TAB dr 200mg 30's pack 240.60 BDT

The anterior chamber is then irrigated with balanced salt solution to remove all excess dye. An anterior capsulotomy can then be performed.

Contra-indication:  (Trypan blue) is contraindicated when a non-hydrated (dry state), hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) is planned to be inserted into the eye because the dye may be absorbed by the IOL and stain the IOL.

Side effects: Adverse reactions reported following use of  (trypan blue) include discoloration of high water content hydrogen intraocular lenses and inadvertent staining of the posterior lens capsule and vitreous face.

Precaution: General: It is recommended that after injection all excess (trypan blue) be immediately removed from the eye by thorough irrigation of the anterior chamber.

	Indication: Prevention of typhoid, Active immunisation against typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi.


Dose: Intramuscular
Active immunisation against typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi
Adult:  Initial: 0.5 ml, to be given at least 2 wk before expected exposure. Booster immunisation: Repeat dose every 3 yr if exposure continues.

Child: >2 yr: Initial: 0.5 ml, to be given at least 2 wk before expected exposure. Booster immunisation: Repeat dose every 3 yr if exposure continues.

Elderly: Initial: 0.5 ml, to be given at least 2 wk before expected exposure. Booster immunisation: Repeat dose every 3 yr if exposure continues.

Contra-indication: The vaccine protects against typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi. Protection is not conferred against paratyphoid fever or illness caused by non-invasive Salmonella. Typhoid vaccine should not be administered to subjects with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or to subjects having shown signs of hypersensitivity after previous Typhoid vaccine administration, or after any other vaccine containing Vi polysaccharide Salmonella typhi antigens. 
It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved. The administration of Typhoid vaccine should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute severe febrile illness.


Side effects: Most recepients of Typhoid vaccine experience some reactions upon vaccination. These are generally moderate and short in duration. They mainly consist of local reactions at the injection site (erythema, induration and tenderness). Systemic reactions (malaise, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, myalgia and elevated temperature) are reported less commonly. In very rare cases allergic type reactions (pruritus, rash, urticaria) may be observed.

Precaution: Not for treatment of typhoid fever. Vaccination may not provide full proetction thus, travellers should be advised to take all necessary precautions to avoid contact or ingestion of potentially contaminated food or water sources. IM admin: Caution when used in patients with a history of bleeding disorders, patients on anticoagulant treatment or severely immunocompromised patients. Pregnancy, lactation.

Mode of action: Live attenuateTY21a strain lacks enzyme UDP-4-galactose epimerase, which causes lipopolysaccharide to be synthesized under conditions that induce bacterial autolys; the avirulent strain produces enough lipopolysaccharide to evoke a protective immune response. Conveys active immunity via stimulation of production of endogenously produced antibodies

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Concurrent use with antibiotics or immunoglobulins may reduce the efficacy of typhoid vaccine. Mefloquine may increase the efficacy of typhoid vaccine. May reduce the diagnostic effect of tuberculin tests.
Potentially Fatal: Concurrent use with immunosuppressants may increase the adverse effects of live vaccines.Indication: Prophylaxis of Typhoid fever 

Dose: Indicated for selective immunization against typhoid fever for people traveling to endemic areas

1 capsule PO every other day x 4 doses (days 1, 3, 5, and 7)

Swallow 1 hr before meal with cold or luke-warm drink

Booster: Repeat same regimen every 5 yr 

Contra-indication: Congenital and acquired immune deficiency, including treatment with immunosuppressive and antimitotic drugs, acute febrile illness and acute intestinal infection. Safety of the vaccination during pregnancy has not yet been established.

Side effects: In very rare cases, mild gastrointestinal disturbances or a transitory exanthema may occur.

Precaution: Certain antibiotics as well as sulfonamides are active against Salmonellae. These products should not be given simultaneously with Vivotif.
Other inoculations, including live vaccines, may be administered at the same time.

Mode of action: Live attenuated oral vaccine; conveys active immunity via stimulation of production of endogenously produced antibodies.

	Indication: Emergency contraception, For pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age

Dose: Emergency Contraception: 
Instruct patients to take one tablet orally as soon as possible within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse or a known or suspected contraceptive failure.
If vomiting occurs within 3 hours of Ulipristal Acetate intake, consideration should be given to repeating the dose.

Uterine Fibroids: 
The treatment consists of 1 tablet of 5 mg to be taken orally once daily for up to 3 months. This 3-month treatment course can be repeated once. Re-treatment should start at the earliest during the second menstruation following the 1st treatment course completion.
Treatments should always be started during the 1st week of menstruation.

If a patient misses a dose, the patient should take ulipristal acetate as soon as possible.
If the dose was missed by >12 hrs, the patient should not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule.

Contra-indication: Ulipristal Acetate is contraindicated for use in the case of known or suspected pregnancy. 
Hypersensitivity to ulipristal acetate or to any of the excipients.
Genital bleedng or unknown aetiology or for reasons other than uterine fibroids.
Uterine, cervical, ovarian or breast cancer. 
Breastfeeding. 


Side effects: Side effects are mild to moderate. Most common side effects are:
Headache; Vertigo
Dizziness, tired feeling;
Nausea, stomach pain; 
Menstrual pain, acne
Excessive sweating, hot flushes,
Muscle or bone pain.


Precaution: Existing Pregnancy
Not indicated for termination of an existing pregnancy. Pregnancy should be excluded before prescribing Ulipristal Acetate.

Ectopic Pregnancy
A history of ectopic pregnancy is not a contraindication to use of this emergency contraceptive method. 

Repeated Use
Ulipristal Acetate is for occasional use as an emergency contraceptive. It should not replace a regular method of contraception. Repeated use of Ulipristal Acetate within the same menstrual cycle is not recommended, as safety and efficacy of repeat use within the same cycle has not been evaluated.

Fertility Following Use
A rapid return of fertility is likely following treatment with Ulipristal Acetate for emergency contraception; therefore, routine contraception should be continued or initiated as soon as possible following use of Ulipristal Acetate to ensure ongoing prevention of pregnancy. 
Effect on Menstrual Cycle

After Ulipristal Acetate intake, menses sometimes occur earlier or later than expected by a few days. 

Contraception
Concomitant use of progestagen only pills, a progestagen releasing intrauterine device or combined oral contraceptive pills is not recommended (see Interactions). Although a majority of women taking a therapeutic dose of ulipristal acetate have anovulation, a non hormonal contraceptive method is recommended during treatment.

Sexually Transmitted Infections/HIV
This does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Endometrial Changes
Changes in the histology of the endometrium may be observed in patients treated with ulipristal acetate. These changes are reversible after treatment cessation. These histological changes should not be mistaken for endometrial hyperplasia .

Mode of action: Selective progesterone receptor modulator with antagonistic and partial agonistic effects.

When taken immediately before ovulation, postpones follicular rupture.

It is thought that the primary mechanism of action for emergency contraception is inhibition or delay of ovulation; however, alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation may also occur.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Concomitant administration of medicinal products containing progestagen is not recommended. 
Also concomitant use of ulipristal acetate and potent CYP3A4 inducers (eg, rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, St John´s wort, efzvirenz, nevirapine, long term use of ritonavir) is not recommended.Beximco	Eukrim 10% Cream   15gm tube 30 BDT

	Indication: Psoriasis, Ichthyosis, hyperkeratotic and dry skin conditions, Eczemas

Dose: Urea 10%  cream is applied topically. Wash affected areas well, rinse off all traces of soap, dry, and apply sparingly twice daily.

Contra-indication: Individuals who have hypersensitivity to any of its components.

Side effects: May produce local irritations (including erythema, burning or pruritus) and oedema when applied to sensitive, moist or fissured skin.

Precaution: Avoid application to moist or broken skin.

Mode of action: Urea is an osmotic diuretic similar to mannitol but more irritant. It induces diuresis by increasing osmotic pressure of the glomerular filtrate and increasing excretion of sodium, potassium and chloride ions. Its osmotic effect also draws water from cells e.g. brain, CSF and anterior chamber of the eye, thereby decreasing intracranial or intraocular pressure. Unlike mannitol, urea penetrates the eye and causes a rebound increase in intraocular pressure if the plasma concentration of the drug is less than that in the vitreous humour. Applied topically, urea promotes hydration of keratin and mild keratolysis in dry skin. It increases water uptake by the stratum corneum and has an antipruritic effect.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased excretion of lithium.Indication: Female infertility, Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism

Dose: Injection
Polycystic ovarian syndrome
Adult: Initially, 150 IU daily SC/IM for the first 5 days. Adjust subsequent dosing based on clinical monitoring (e.g. serum oestradiol levels and vaginal ultrasound). Dose adjustments should not be made more frequently than once every 2 days and be <75-150 units per adjustment. Max dose: 450 units daily and max course of treatment: 12 days. 

Stop treatment when adequate response obtained as determined by oestrogen monitoring or ultrasonic visualisation of follicles. A single dose of chorionic gonadotrophin 5000 to 10 000 units is given to induce ovulation after 1-2 days. Urofollitropin treatment may be tried again in future cycles.

Female infertility
Adult: Initially, 150 IU daily SC/IM for the first 5 days. Adjust subsequent dosing based on clinical monitoring (e.g. serum oestradiol levels and vaginal ultrasound). Dose adjustments should not be made more frequently than once every 2 days and be <75-150 units per adjustment. Max dose: 450 units daily and max course of treatment: 12 days. Stop treatment when adequate response obtained as determined by oestrogen monitoring or ultrasonic visualisation of follicles. A single dose of chorionic gonadotrophin 5000 to 10 000 units is given to induce ovulation after 1-2 days. Urofollitropin treatment may be tried again in future cycles.

In vitro fertilisation procedures or other assisted conception techniques
Adult: In conjunction with other agents: 150-225 units of FSH daily SC/IM from day 2 or 3 of menstrual cycle. Alternatively, begin therapy with clomifene citrate and continue with urofollitropin; or urofollitropin may be given after gonadorelin analogue is given to suppress gonadotrophin release. Continue treatment until an adequate response is obtained and admin 5000 to 10 000 units of chorionic gonadotrophin 1-2 days after final injection of urofollitropin. Oocyte retrieval is performed 34-35 hr later.

Male infertility
Adult: In conjunction with chorionic gonadotrophin, 150 units of FSH SC/IM 3 times a wk, continue for at least 4 mth.

Contra-indication: Pregnancy, ovarian cysts or enlargement not due to polycystic ovary syndrome, primary ovarian failure, organic intracranial lesion e.g. pituitary tumour, uncontrolled thyroid and adrenal dysfunction, presence of any cause of infertility other than anovulation, abnormal bleeding of undetermined origin.

Side effects: Nausea, vomiting, joint pain, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, adnexal torsion, mild to moderate ovarian enlargement, abdominal pain, ovarian cysts, local reaction at inj site, headaches, haemoperitoneum, benign and malignant ovarian neoplasms, ascites, pleural effusion, hypovolaemia, thromboembolic disorders. Weight gain, acne and gynaecomastia in men.
Potentially Fatal: Ovarian cysts rupture, intraperitoneal haemorrhage.

Precaution: May result in multiple pregnancies. Abnormal genital bleeding, hormone sensitive malignancies, ovarian cysts not caused by polycystic ovary syndrome. Exclude and treat other causes of infertility e.g. pituitary or hypothalamic lesions, adrenal or thyroid disorders and hyperprolactinaemia.

Mode of action: Urofollitropin, a gonadotrophin obtained from postmenopausal women's urine, possesses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) activity but almost no luteinising activity. Admin for 7-12 days results in follicular growth and maturation in females. When sufficient follicular maturation has occurred, human chorionic gonadotrophin should be given to induce ovulation.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with drugs with luteinising hormone activity.Indication: Acute MI, Pulmonary embolism, Thromboembolism, Deep vein thrombosis

Dose: Adult: IV Deep vein thrombosis; Pulmonary embolism Initial: 4,400 u/kg over 10 mins, then 4,400 u/kg/hr for 12-24 hr (deep vein thrombosis) or 12 hr (pulmonary embolism). 

Acute MI 2-3 million u as infusion. Peripheral arterial thromboembolism As 2,000 u/ml soln: Infuse into a clot via a catheter at a rate of 4,000 u/min for 2 hr. Monitor response using angiography. If clot is not removed, the catheter is advanced into the occluded vessel and continue infusion for another 2 hr. May repeat procedure up to 4 times if needed. If blood flow is re-established, partially remove cathether and infuse at 1,000 u/min till remaining clot has lysed. Inj Clearance of occluded catheters and shunts Instill 5,000 - 25,000 u into affected IV catheter or shunt and clamped for up to 4 hr. Aspirate the lysate and repeat the procedure if needed. 

Irrigation Break down of clots in hyphaema Dissolve 5,000 u in 2 mL of sterile distilled water. Irrigate the anterior chamber with 0.3 mL of the prepared soln and leave it in situ for 3 mins before washing out w/ saline. Repeat 5 times. May leave 0.3 mL in the anterior chamber for 24-48 hr if residual clot is still present at the end.

Contra-indication: Active internal bleeding; history of cerebrovascular accident; recent (within 2 mth) trauma of any kind including surgery; aneurysm; known bleeding diathesis; severe uncontrolled hypertension. Recent history of peptic ulcer disease, oesophageal varices, ulcerative colitis or other bleeding GI lesions; pancreatitis; subacute bacterial endocarditis; coagulation defects including those due to liver or kidney disease, or after recent surgery, childbirth or trauma. Increased risk of cerebral bleeding e.g. recent stroke or cerebral neoplasm. Pregnancy.

Side effects: Bleeding, pyrexia, haematuria, thromboembolic episodes, hypersensitivity reactions.
Potentially Fatal: Severe bleeding, anaphylaxis.

Precaution: Any vascular punctures or invasive procedures should be avoided as far as possible during, and immediately before and after urokinase therapy and if unavoidable done with great care. External chest compression. Caution in conditions eg, possibility of left heart thrombus, subacute bacterial endocarditis, coagulation defects, cerebrovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy and any conditions in which bleeding could be dangerous. Monitor for reperfusion arrhythmias when used in MI.

Mode of action: Urokinase, an enzyme isolated from human urine, directly converts plasminogen into plasmin, which is a proteolytic enzyme with fibrinolytic effects. It is a fibrin non-specific thrombolytic as it affects both unbound and fibrin bound plasminogen.

Pregnancy category: B

Interaction: Reduced thrombolytic effect when given again some time later due to development of high levels of antibodies.
Potentially Fatal: Platelet inhibitors eg, aspirin and indometacin can potentiate the action of urokinase and cause haemorrhage. Heparin and oral anticoagulants may increase risk of bleeding.ACI	Bilicir TAB dr 300mg   BDT

CMV Prevention in Kidney & Heart Transplant

<4 months: Safety and efficacy not established

4 months -16 years: Daily dose = 7 mg x BSA x CrCl; not to exceed 900 mg/day 

Begin within 10 days of transplant until 100 days post-transplant

Calculate BSA by Mosteller equation

    BSA (sq.meter) = height (cm) X weight (kg) divided by 3600 

Calculate CrCl by Schwartz equation

    CrCl (mL/min/1.73 sq.meter) = K x height (cm) divided by serum Cr (mg/dL)
    If CrCl exceeds 150 mL/min/1.73 sq.meter, then use maximum value of 150 mL/min/1.73 sq.meter; an upper limit of 150 mL/min/1.73 sq. meter helps prevent the potential for over dosing
    If the calculated pediatric dose exceeds 900 mg, a dose of 900 mg should be given to the child
    Where K =
    0.45 for aged 4 months to <2 yr

	Indication: Chickenpox

Dose: Adults
Indicated for all adults without evidence of immunity to varicella.

2 dose series: 0.5 mL SC, repeat at least 4 weeks later.

Routine vaccination

    2 dose series: 0.5 mL SC
    1st dose: 12-15 months
    2nd dose: 4-6 years; may be administered before age 4 yr, provided at least 3 months have elapsed since the first dose

Contra-indication: Do not administer  to individuals with a history of anaphylactic or severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine (including neomycin and gelatin) or to a previous dose of a varicella-containing vaccine.

Side effects: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Precaution: 5.1 Management of Allergic Reactions

Adequate treatment provisions, including epinephrine injection (1:1000), should be available for immediate use should anaphylaxis occur.

5.2 Family History of Immunodeficiency

Vaccination should be deferred in patients with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency until the patient's immune status has been evaluated and the patient has been found to be immunocompetent.

5.3 Use in HIV-Infected Individuals

The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommendations on the use of varicella vaccine in HIV-infected individuals.

5.4 Risk of Vaccine Virus Transmission

Post-marketing experience suggests that transmission of vaccine virus may occur rarely between healthy vaccinees who develop a varicella-like rash and healthy susceptible contacts. Transmission of vaccine virus from a mother who did not develop a varicella-like rash to her newborn infant has been reported.

Mode of action: Live, attenuated varicella virus stimulates active immunity to disease caused by varicella-zoster virus.

Conveys active immunity via stimulation of production of endogenously produced antibodies .

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Concurrent use may interfere with the immune response to certain live vaccines.Indication: Varicella infection

Dose:  Usually, 1 dose (0.5 mL) is injected SC. Adults and adolescents: 0.5 mL dose administered SC at elected date then a 2nd 0.5 mL dose 4-8 weeks later. 

Children 12 months-12 years: 0.5 mL as a single dose to be administered SC. 

Contra-indication:  A history of hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine; individuals with blood dyscrasias, leukonia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasma affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems; individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy.


Side effects: Hemic and Lymphatic System: Thrombocytopenia, nervous, encephalitic, respiratory skin (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, secondary bacterial infections of skin and soft tissue including impetigo and cellulitis, herpes zoster).
Fever and rash occasionally appear in healthy children and adults 1-3 weeks after vaccination.  Anaphylactoid symptoms eg, urticaria, dyspnea, lip edema or laryngeal edema may appear rarely. A hypersensitivity reaction may rarely occur immediately after vaccination by the day following vaccination, with the appearance of rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and fever. A local reaction eg, redness, swelling and induration may rarely occur at the injection site.


Precaution: General: 
Before vaccination, the general health condition of the vaccine recipient should be evaluated clinically by taking their temperature and being examined (inspection, auscultation, etc) by a physician.
Adequate treatment provisions including epinephrine injection (1:1000), should be available for immediate use should an anaphylactoid reaction occur.
Vaccination should be deferred to at least 5 months following blood or plasma transfusion, or administration of immunoglobulin or varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG).
Vaccine recipients should avoid use of salicylate for 6 weeks after vaccination as rege's syndrome has been reported following the use of salicylate during varicella infection.
Vaccination should be deferred in patients with a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency until the patient's own immune system has been evaluated.
Cases Requiring Careful Consideration Before Vaccination: The decision for vaccination is to be made carefully in the following categories, those having a history of seizures; those previously diagnosed with an immunodeficiency; those suffering from diseases accompanied by abnormal immune system function or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see Dosage & Administration); and those suspected of being allergic to any of the components of Okavax.
Use in pregnancy: Women of childbearing age are to be warned to practice appropriate birth control for approximately 1 month before vaccination and to avoid becoming pregnant for at least 2 months after vaccination.
Use in children: No clinical data are available on the safety or efficacy of Okavax vaccine in children <1 year, therefore, administration in infants <12 months is not recommended.
Use in the elderly: Since the elderly frequently have decreased physiologic function, it is advisable to carefully evaluate the health condition before vaccination.

Mode of action: Varicella-zoster immunoglobulins are used for passive immunisation against varicella. It is recommended for use in susceptible persons who are at high risk of developing varicella-associated complications after exposure to varicella or herpes zoster (shingles).

Pregnancy category: C

For arrythmias in digitalized patients, Verapamil should be given 240 mg to 360 mg in divided doses, depending on the severity of the condition. Divided doses up to 180 mg/day may occasionally be needed.

Intravenous: Adults: 5mg slowly intravenously, in tachycardias and hypertensive crises, if necessary repeat after 5 to 10 minutes. 

Drip infusion to maintain the therapeutic effect: 5-10 mg/hour in physiological saline, glucose, laevulose or similar solutions, on average up to a total dose of 100mg/day.   

Children: Newborn 0.75-1mg (= 0.3-0.4ml) 
Infants 0.75-2mg (= 0.3-0.8ml) 
Children age 1-5 years: 2-3mg (= 0.8-1.2ml) 
age 6-14 years: 2.5-5mg (= 1-2ml) of Verapamil, given intravenously, depending on age and action. 

The injection should be made slowly under electrocardiographic control and only until onset of the effect. 

Intravenous infusion in hypertensive crises: initially 0.05-0.1mg/kg/hour; if the effect proves to be insufficient, the dose is increased at 30-60 minute intervals until twice the dose or more is reached. Average total dose up to 1.5mg/kg/day.

Contra-indication: Severe left ventricular dysfunction, hypotension or cardiogenic shockSick sinus syndrome (except in patients with a functioning artificial ventricular pacemaker)Second or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker)Patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation and an accessory by pass tract(eg. Wolff-Parkinson-White, Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome)Patients with known hypersensitivity to verapamil hydrochlorideVerapamil injection should not be administered intravenously to patients on beta-blockers (except in an intensive care setting) and known hypersensitivity to Verapamil hydrochloride.

Side effects: Verapamil is generally well tolerated. The following reaction to orally administered Verapamil appeared clearly drug related or occurred at rates greater than 1% in clinical trials with approximately 5000 patients.Digestive system: Constipation, nausea;Cardiovascular system: Hypotension, edema, CHF, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, AV block;Respiratory system: Upper respiratory tract infections;Nervous system: Dizziness, headache, fatigue;Skin: Rash, flashing;Hepatic: Elevated liver enzyme.

Precaution: Care should be taken in 1st degree AV block, bradycardia <50 beats/minutes, hypotension <90 mm Hg systolic pressure, atrial fibrillation/flutter and simultaneous pre-excitation syndrome e.g. WPW syndrome, heart failure (previous compensation with cardiac glycosides/diuretics required).Verapamil may impair ability to drive or operate machinery, particularly in the initial stages of treatment and with concomitant consumption of alcohol. 

Verapamil markedly slows down the elimination of alcohol and prolongs the duration of the effects of alcohol.Verapamil should be given as a slow intravenous injection over at least 2 minutes under continuous ECG and blood pressure monitoring. Intravenous injection should only be given by the physician.In atrial fibrillation and simultaneous WPW syndrome there is a risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation

Mode of action: Verapamil inhibits entry of calcium ions into arterial smooth muscle cells as well as the myocytes and conducting tissue. These actions lead to reversal and preventions of coronary artery spasm, reduction in afterload through peripheral vasodilatation and reduction in ventricular rate in patients with chronic atrial flutter or fibrillation and reduction in the occurrence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Verapamil reduces BP, relieves angina and slows AV conduction.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased cardiac depressant effects with ?-blockers and flecainide. Increased risk of additive bradycardia, conduction disturbances and digoxin toxicity with digoxin. Increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension with remifentanil and sufentanil. Increased levels of both everolimus and verapamil on concurrent use. May increase doxorubicin, buspirone, carbamazepine, ciclosporin, epirubicin, eplerenone, quinidine, statins, sirolimus, tacrolimus, quinupristin/dalfopristin levels. Verapamil increase blood alcohol levels. Unpredictable interactions with lithium. Decreased verapamil concentrations with phenobarbital, sulfinpyrazone, rifampicin, rifabutin and rifapentine. Increased verapamil concentrations with protease inhibitors and cimetidine.

Potentially Fatal: Increased cardiac depressant effects with amiodarone. Increased risk of QT prolongation with dofetilide, ranolazine, sertindole. Additive bradycardia with ivabradine. Increased risk of heart block with clonidine. Increased risk of acute hyperkalaemia and CV collapse with dantrolene.JHP Pharmaceuticals, USA	Visudyne Injection 15mg/vial 15 mg ( in singel- use glass ) vial 137280 BDT
	Indication: Neovascular age-related macular degeneration

Dose: Adult: IV 6 mg/m2, followed by activation using laser (at a wavelength of 689 nm) 15 mins after starting infusion. Recommended light dose: 50 J/cm2 over 83 sec. Repeat 3 mthly for recurrent choroidal neovascular leakage.

Contra-indication: Porphyria; lactation.

Side effects: Visual disturbances; severe vision loss with or without subretinal or vitreous bleeding; inj site reactions; nausea; photosensitivity; asthenia; cataracts; blepharitis; conjunctivitis; dry eyes; ocular itching; flu-like syndrome; atrial fibrillation; hypertension; peripheral vascular disorder; varicose veins; eczema; constipation; GI cancers; fever; lachrymation disorder; hypersensitivity reactions; increased LFT.

Precaution: Moderate to severe hepatic disorders; biliary disorders. Pregnancy. Use the largest arm vein possible (e.g. antecubital) especially in elderly and avoid small veins in the back of the hand. Stop infusion if extravasation occurs and protect extravasation area from direct light and apply cold compresses. Patient to be under close monitoring during verteporfin infusion and exercise caution when general anaesthesia is considered. Avoid exposure of unprotected skin, eyes or other body organs to direct sunlight or bright indoor light for 5 days after treatment. Protect all parts of skin and eyes by wearing protective clothing and dark sunglasses (sunscreens are ineffective) if going outdoors in daylight is necessary. Exposure to ambient indoor light is encouraged as it helps in gradual inactivation of any remaining drug.

Mode of action: Verteporfin, when activated by low-intensity nonheat-generating laser light at a wavelength corresponding to its absorption peak, generates highly reactive, short-lived singlet O2 and reactive O2 radicals that cause local damage to neovascular endothelium, resulting in vessel occlusion. It appears to accumulate preferentially in the neovasculature e.g. choroidal neovasculature.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Increased rate of verteporfin uptake by the vascular endothelium with calcium channel blockers, polymyxin B or radiation therapy. Increased photosensitivity with photosensitizing agents (e.g. tetracyclines, sulfonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide diuretics and griseofulvin). Decreased verteporfin efficacy with compounds that quench active oxygen species or scavenge radicals e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide, betacarotene, ethanol, formate and mannitol. Decreased verteporfin efficacy with drugs that decrease clotting, vasoconstriction or platelet aggregation e.g. thromboxane A2 inhibitors. Anaesthetics may cause haemodynamic effects.Acme Ltd.

	Indication: Type 2 DM

Dose: Adult: PO W/ metformin or a thiazolidinedione: 50 mg twice daily; w/ a sulfonylurea: 50 mg/day in the morning. Not recommended to use >100 mg/day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to vildagliptin

Side effects: Hypoglycaemia, delayed gastric emptying, nausea and vomiting. Flu-like symptoms, headache and dizziness may occur.
Potentially Fatal: Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Precaution: Renal impairment.

Mode of action: Vildagliptin is a dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that improves glycaemic control by preventing DPP-4 from inactivating the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, thus prolonging incretin activity in response to ingestion of nutrients. This increases insulin sensitivity, decreases glucagon secretion and improves ?-cell function.

Adult: Initially, 3.7 mg/m2, increase dose wkly based on WBC counts in increments of about 1.8 mg/m2 until leukocyte count decreases to about 3000/mm3, or max wkly dose of 18.5 mg/m2 reached. Do not increase dose if leukocyte count is reduced to approximately 3000 cells/mm3; administer the max dose that does not cause leucopenia for maintenance. Do not increase subsequent doses if onolytic activity occurs before leucopenic effect. Usual dose: 5.5-7.4 mg/m2 per wk. Do not admin next dose, even though 7 days have lapsed unless the leukocyte count has returned to at least 4000/mm3.


Child: Initial 2.5 mg/m2 of BSA, increased dose at wkly intervals in increments of about 1.25 mg/m2 until leukocyte count decreases to about 3000/ mm3, or max wkly dose of 12.5 mg/m2 reached. Do not increase dose once leukocyte count reaches approximately 3000 cells/mm3, instead, a dose of 1 increment smaller to be admin at wkly intervals for maintenance i.e. patient receives the max dose that does not cause leucopenia. If onolytic activity is encountered before leucopenic effect, then there is no need to increase subsequent doses. Do not admin next dose, even though 7 days have lapsed unless the leukocyte count has returned to at least 4000/mm3. Duration of maintenance therapy depends on disease state and the antineoplastic agent combination.

	Indication: Daily multivitamin maintenance dosage for adults and children aged 11 years and above receiving parenteral nutrition. It is also indicated in other situations include surgery, extensive burns, fractures and other trauma, severe infectious diseases and comatose states, which may provoke a "stress" situation with profound alterations in the body's metabolic demands and consequent tissue depletion of nutrients.

Dose: Adults and children aged 11 years and above: 1 vial/day 

Administration procedure: The single dose vial is reconstituted by adding 5ml of sterile Water for injection or other intravenous fluids like 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection or 5% Glucose injection. 5 ml of diluent should be added by means of sterile syringe into the vial and gently mixed to dissolve the lyophilized powder. The entire volume of the resultant solution should then be administered by slow Intravenous injection (at least over 10 minutes) or further diluted for intravenous infusion. To minimize vitamin losses in parenteral nutrition admixtures, add the vitamins immediately prior to administration and complete administration within 24 hours.

Contra-indication: This is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing hypervitaminosis or known hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients. This product should not be injected to patients with pre-existing intolerance to thiamine. 

Similarly, this product should not be administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. This preparation should not be administered to those suffering from hyperparathyroidism due to hypercalcaemic complications.

Side effects: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported following large intravenous doses of Thiamine. Urticaria and rash have also been associated with this preparation. There have been very rare reports of anaphylactic reactions following IV injection/infusion with this preparation over 1-4 minutes.

Precaution: Anaphylactic reactions may occur in allergic subjects who are susceptible to Thiamine (Vitamin B1) and nicotinamide components of this product. Mild allergic reactions such as sneezing or mild asthma are warning signs that further injection/infusion may give rise to anaphylactic shock. Due to glychocolic acid content, repeated and prolonged administration in patients with jaundice of hepatic origin or severe biochemical evidence of cholestatis requires careful monitoring of liver function. Also in the case of impaired kidney function, fat-soluble vitamin levels should be carefully monitored.

	Indication: Vitamin/mineral deficiency. Prevention of vitamin lacking symptom for growing child, lack of appetite child, including patient under rehabilitating period.

Dose: Infants (<1 year): Half teaspoonful daily. Children (1 - 4 years): One teaspoonful daily. Children (> 4 years): One & half teaspoonful daily. Adults: Two teaspoonful daily. Women of child bearing age (including pregnancy & lactation): One teaspoonful daily. It can be taken with water or milk if desired.


Contra-indication: This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.

Side effects: Generally well tolerated. However, a few allergic reactions may be seen.

Precaution: This medicine may accumulate in the body, which cause danger. So, it should not use over dosage or use continuously except recommended by physicians

Mode of action: It contains 8 vitamins and fatty acid (cod liver oil). Cod liver oil is composed of vitamin A, D, EPA and DHA. Both EPA & DHA are omega-3 fatty acids. These omega-3 fatty acids keep blood triglycerides in check (high triglycerides are generally linked with increased risk of heart diseases) and may inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis. They also have anti-inflammatory activity; as a result they are also helpful in Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. It has been also found that omega- 3 fatty acids are needed for prostaglandin formation. Probably as a result of their effect on prostaglandin they are responsible for blood vessel dilation. A double blind trial found that omega- 3 fatty acids helped to treat patient with Raynaud's disease. It has been also found that EPA & DHA have some preventive role in cancer and prevent cardiac arrhythmia.

	Indication: Vitamin B deficiency. Glossitis, stomatitis, cheilosis, beriberi polyneuritis.

Dose: Tablet/Capsule : 1-2, 3 times daily or as directed by the physician. Syrup : 2-3 teaspoonful daily. Injection : 2 ml daily IV or IM. 

Contra-indication: Contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to any of its components.

Side effects: Generally well tolerated.

Precaution: Should be given cautiously to patients taking Levodopa as Pyridoxine reduces the effect of Levodopa.

Mode of action: Vitamin B: Plays a role in the synthesis and maintenance of coenzyme A. Necessary for lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, tissue respiration, glycogenolysis, inhibition of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. May increaase chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin): Required for the maintenance of normal erthropoiesis, nucleprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth; intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric mucosa, is required for active absorption of Vitamin B12 from the GI tract. Necessary for normal tissue respiration; plays a role in activation of pyridoxine and conversion of tryptophan to niacin.

	Indication: Supplement for intravenous nutrition in order to meet the daily requirements of the water-soluble vitamins in infants, adults and children. 

Dose: Adults and children age 11 years and above: One vial (10 ml) daily. 1-2 Capsule daily.
Children below 11 years of age: Children weighing less than 10 kg should be given 1 ml of the dissolved mixture per kg body weight /day.
Children weighing 10 kg or more should be given 10 ml (one vial) of the dissolved mixture /day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the preparation.

Side effects: The unwanted effects of nutrient solutions are a rise in the body temperature, shivering, chills and nausea and vomiting. Adverse reactions that may be expected based on experience with other water-soluble vitamin compounds administered intravenously include: allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis; dermatological reactions including flushing, erythema and pruritus and CNS reactions including headache, dizziness and agitation etc.

Precaution: Folic acid may mask the symptoms of pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurologic manifestations remain progressive. Administering folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia. Recommended doses are insufficient to correct severe vitamin deficiency states and may be insufficient in patients with markedly increased vitamin requirements. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), routine supplementation with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is recommended to prevent deficiency states and to obviate the need to speculate on individual vitamin status. Daily vitamin requirements must be calculated to avoid over dosage and toxic effects, especially with regards to vitamins A & D and particularly in pediatric patients. 

In patients for whom total parenteral nutrition is continued for prolonged periods (months or years), periodic monitoring of blood vitamin levels should be considered. To prevent excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins and for reasons of safety, daily dosage should be administered over a number of hours. 

Mode of action: Vitamin B: Plays a role in the synthesis and maintenance of coenzyme A. Necessary for lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, tissue respiration, glycogenolysis, inhibition of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. May increaase chylomicron triglyceride removal from plasma. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin): Required for the maintenance of normal erthropoiesis, nucleprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth; intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric mucosa, is required for active absorption of Vitamin B12 from the GI tract. Necessary for normal tissue respiration; plays a role in activation of pyridoxine and conversion of tryptophan to niacin.
Vitamin C is necessary for collagen formation and tissue repair; plays a role in oxidation/reduction reactions as well as other metabolic pathways including synthesis of catecholamines, carnitine, and steroids; also plays a role in conversion of folic acid to folinic acid.

Interaction:Aristopharma	Arovital Injection  1's vial 200 BDT
	Indication: It is intended as a supplement for intravenous nutrition in order to meet the daily requirements of the water-soluble vitamins in infants, children and adults. 

Dose: Adults: For adult patients and children weighing 10 kg or more, the recommended daily doses are the content of 1 vial (10 ml).

Children: Children weighing less than 10 kg should be given 1/10 of the content of one vial i.e. 1 ml per kg body weight per day.

Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the preparation. 

Side effects: The unwanted effects of nutrient solutions are a rise in the body temperature, shivering, chills and nausea and vomiting. Other rare unwanted effects include: allergic reactions; breathing difficulties (rapid breathing, shortness of breath); effects on blood pressure, abdominal pain, tiredness, headaches, flushing, slight pressure over the eyes and dizziness. 

Precaution: Administering folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), routine supplementation with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is recommended to prevent deficiency states and to obviate the need to speculate on individual vitamin status. Daily vitamin requirements must be calculated to avoid over dosage and toxic effects, especially with regards to vitamins A & D and particularly in pediatric patients. In patients for whom total parenteral nutrition is continued for prolonged periods (months or years), periodic monitoring of blood vitamin levels should be considered. To prevent excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins and for reasons of safety, daily dosage should be administered over a number of hours. 

Mode of action: Water-soluble vitamins for infusion. They act as coenzymes of vital enzymes associated with crucial physiological processes, energy metabolism, cell growth and replenishment especially in brain and nerve cells and gives better synergistic action. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant and helps in collagen formation. Intravenous administration of this combination gives prompt action with fine pharmacological properties in body in terms of efficacy and tolerability.

	Indication: B1, B6 and B12 deficiency syndrome, sciatica, lumbago, trigeminal neuralgia, facial paralysis, optic neuritis, Diabetic neuropathy,  Peripheral neuralgia, Myalgia 

Dose: Tablet: 1-2 tablets three times daily.

Injection: In severe cases, 1 ampoule daily until the acute symptoms subsides. For milder cases, & follow up therapy 2 or 3 should be injected weekly.

Contra-indication: Should not be used in the patients on Levodopa therapy and hypersensitivity to any of the active ingredients.

Side effects: Generally well tolerated. However, a few allergic reactions may be seen.

Precaution: Cyanocobalamin should not be given before a diagnosis has been fully established because of the possibility of masking symptoms of subacute degeneration of the spinal cord. Cyanocobalamin is not a suitable form of Vitamin B12 for the treatment of optic neuropathies associated with raised plasma concentrations of cyanocobalamin.

Mode of action: Vitamin B1 (Thiamine), B6 (Pyridoxine) & B12 (Cyanocobalamin). These vitamins play essential role as co-enzyme for the metabolism of nervous system. Thus this combination normalizes the nerve cell metabolism. This combination supports the regeneration of nerve fibers and myelin sheath by activation of the metabolism and the natural repair mechanism. The combination of these 3 vitamins shows better efficacy than that of the individual components. In addition, Vitamin B1, B6 & B12 promote body's own repair mechanism and work in pain management.

Pregnancy category: Not Classified

Interaction:Indication: Biotin deficiency,  tissue maintenance, healthy skin, nails & hairs, weight loss,  Hairfall, premature greying, neuropathy, relief from heart problems, alopecia, Parkinson’s disease, Rett syndrome and vaginal candidiasis.

Dose: An adequate amount of biotin is about 30 to 100 mcg daily. The biotin,  used for nutritional supplement and food labeling purposes, is 300 micrograms/day. 

Doses of up to 2,500 mcg have been used safely to treat hair and nail problems. Higher intakes have been recommended for reducing blood sugar levels in diabetics (5-15 mg/d). Vitamin B 7 works best when combined with B-vitamins. 

Contra-indication: 

Side effects: No side effects have been reported for biotin in amounts up to 10 milligrams a day. Like other water soluble B-vitamins, excess biotin is excreted in the urine. Even when taken in high doses (2,500 mcg to treat hair and nail problems), there are no known side effects. In people without disorders of biotin metabolism, doses of up to 5 mg/day for two years were not associated with adverse effects.

Precaution: Biotin deficiency can be induced in humans by feeding them raw egg whites, which contain a protein that binds biotin and prevents its absorption. Long-term antibiotic use can interfere with biotin production in the intestine and increase the risk of deficiency symptoms, such as dermatitis, depression, hair loss, anemia, and nausea. Long-term use of anti-seizure medications may also lead to biotin deficiency. Biotin deficiency results in fatigue, depression, nausea, muscle pains, hair loss, and anemia. Biotin is necessary for both metabolism and growth in humans, particularly with reference to production of fatty acids, antibodies, digestive enzymes, and in niacin (vitamin B3) metabolism. 



Mode of action: Biotin is necessary for the proper functioning of enzymes that transport carboxyl units and fix carbon dioxide, and is required for various metabolic functions, including gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, propionate metabolism, and catabolism of branched-chain amino acids.

	Indication: Venous thromboembolism, Stroke prevention

Dose: Oral
Treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism
Adult: Initially, 5 mg daily. Rapid anti-coagulation: Initially, 10 mg daily for 2 days. Adjust subsequent doses based on PT/INR. Usual maintenance dose: 2-10 mg daily.
Elderly: Lower initial dose.
Hepatic impairment: Severe: Avoid.



Contra-indication: 1. Actual or potential haemorrhagic conditions, eg. Peptic ulcer, or to patients with uncontrolled hypertension
2. Severe hepatic or renal disease
3. Pregnancy
4. Known hypersensitivity to warfarin
5. Bacterial endocarditis
Its use within 24 hours following surgery or labour should be undertaken with caution, if at all.

Side effects: Hemorrhage is the principal adverse effect of oral anticoagulants. Other adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersensitivity, rash, alopecia, and unexplained drop in haematocrit, "purple toes", skin necrosis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction.

Precaution: Periodic determination of prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or other suitable coagulation test is essential. Numerous factors, alone or in combination, including travel, changes in diet, environment, physical state and medication may influence response of the patient to anticoagulants. It is generally good practice to monitor the patient's response with additional PT/INR determination in the period immediately after discharge from the hospital, and whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued or taken irregularly. 

The following factors may exaggerate the effects of warfarin and necessitate a reduction in dosage; loss of weight, elderly subject, acute illness, deficient renal function, decreased dietary intake of vitamin K, administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Factors which may call for an increase in maintenance dosage include weight gain, diarrhea and vomiting, increased intake of vitamin K, fats and oils, and the administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Careful additional laboratory control is necessary if the patient is to be changed from one formulation to another. Reversal of warfarin anticoagulation by vitamin K takes several days. In emergency situations fresh frozen plasma should be given.

Mode of action: Warfarin inhibits synthesis of vit K-dependent coagulation factors VII, IX, X and II and anticoagulant protein C and its cofactor protein S. No effects on established thrombus but further extension of the clot can be prevented. Secondary embolic phenomena are avoided.

Pregnancy category: X

Interaction: Cholestatic hepatitis may occur when taken concomitantly w/ ticlopidine. Increased risk of bleeding w/ other anticoagulants (e.g. argatroban, dabigatran, heparin), antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel), NSAIDs (e.g. celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. citalopram, paroxetine, venlafaxine). Increased INR w/ CYP2C9 (e.g. amiodarone, capecitabine, cotrimoxazole), CYP1A2 (e.g. aciclovir, allopurinol, ciprofloxacin) and CYP3A4 (e.g. alprazolam, amlodipine, atorvastatin) inhibitors. Decreased INR w/ CYP2C9, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 inducers.

	Indication: Yellow fever infection

Dose: Primary Vaccination: Adults and Children >9 months: 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine administered as a single dose.

Children <9 months: The vaccine must not be given to children <6 months. Vaccination against yellow fever is not usually recommended in children aged from 6 months up to 9 months except in specific circumstances and in accordance with available official recommendations, in which case, the dose is the same as in older children and adults.

The vaccine should be given at least 10 days before entering an endemic area since protective immunity may not be achieved until at least this time has elapsed.

Elderly: The dose is the same as for adults. However, due to a higher risk of yellow fever vaccine-associated severe and potentially fatal disease in persons from 60 years of age, the vaccine should only be given when it is considered that there is a considerable and unavoidable risk of acquiring yellow fever infection.

Re-Vaccination: Re-vaccination with 1 dose of 0.5mL is recommended every 10 years in persons considered to be at risk of exposure. International Health Regulations (IHR) require re-vaccination, using the same dose as for primary vaccination, at intervals of 10 years in order to retain a valid certificate.

For IM use, the recommended injection sites are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in the infants and toddlers (6 months up to 2 years of age) and the deltoid muscle in older children and adults.


Contra-indication: Hypersensitivity reaction to eggs, chicken proteins or to any component of this vaccine.
Serious hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any yellow fever vaccine.
Immunosuppression, whether congenital, idiopathic or as a result of treatment with systemic steroids (greater than the standard dose of topical or inhaled steroids), radiotherapy or cytotoxic drugs.
History of thymus dysfunction (including thymoma, thymectomy).
Symptomatic HIV infection.
Asymptomatic HIV infection when accompanied by evidence of impaired immune function (see Precautions).
Age <6 months (see Dosage & Administration and Precautions).
Current severe febrile illness.

Side effects:  Hypersensitivity. The most common adverse reactions occurring after vaccine administration were local reactions. Nervous System Disorders: Very Common: Headache.
Gastrointestinal System Disorders: Common: Nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting. Uncommon: Abdominal pain.
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Common: Myalgia. Uncommon: Arthralgia.
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Very Common: Local reactions (including pain, redness, hematoma, induration, swelling). Common: Pyrexia, asthenia.

Precaution: As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reaction following administration of the vaccine.
Stamaril should be administered only to persons who are or will be at risk of infection with yellow fever virus or who must be vaccinated to comply with IHR.
Immunosuppressed Persons:It must not be administered to immunosuppressed persons.
Children Born to HIV Positive Mothers: Children aged at least 6 months may be vaccinated if it is confirmed that they are not infected with HIV.
HIV-infected children aged at least 6 months who are potentially in need of protection against yellow fever should be referred to a specialist paediatric team for advice on whether or not to vaccinate.
 This vaccine must not be administered to children before the age of 6 months.

Sixty Years and Older: Some serious and potentially fatal adverse reactions (including systemic and neurological reactions persisting >48 hrs, YEL-AVD and YEL-AND) appear to occur at higher frequencies after the age of 60 years. Therefore, the vaccine should only be given to those who have a considerable risk of acquiring yellow fever.
Because IM injection can cause injection site haematoma, Stamaril should not be given by the IM route to persons with any bleeding disorder, eg, haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or to persons on anticoagulant therapy. The subcutaneous route of administration should be used instead.
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this vaccine.



Mode of action: Live, attenuated virus stimulates active immunity to Yellow fever; conveys active immunity via stimulation of production of endogenously produced antibodies.

Patients to contact doctor if they experience muscle weakness, shortness of breath, symptoms of hepatitis or pancreatitis.

Mode of action: Zidovudine is a thymidine analogue. It is phosphorylated in the body to its active form zidovudine triphosphate which interferes in DNA synthesis of retroviruses by inhibiting DNA replication. Zidovudine inhibits the key enzyme reverse transcriptase. Human DNA polymerase is inhibited only at a conc 100 times more than that required to inhibit viral reverse transcriptase.

Pregnancy category: C

Increased haematological toxicity with IV pentamidine, lamivudine, dapsone, vancomycin flucytosine, amphotericin, ganciclovir, interferon alfa, cyclophosphamide and other bone marrow suppressive or cytotoxic agents Increased risk of zidovudine toxicity with atovaquone, chloramphenicol, fluconazole, valproate. Decreased absorption with clarithromycin, minimise interactions by admin at least 2 hours apart. Increased zidovudine concentration and increased potential for hypersensitivity reactions with probenecid. Increased zidovudine clearance and haematological toxicity with rifampicin. Increased bioavailability of zidovudine with nimodipine. Increased incidences of headache with benzodiazepines. Possible increase in zidovudine concentration with methadone.

Potentially Fatal: Avoid stavudine (due to inhibition of activation of stavudine), didanosine, ribavirin (antagonize effect of zidovudine), zalcitabine (inferior virological activity and a higher rate of side effects) with zidovudine. Increased risk of toxicity (e.g. hepatic decompensation, neutropenia) in patients with interferon alfa with or without ribavirin.Eskayef Bangladesh Ltd.	Softi Ointment   15gm pack/50gm pack 35/90 BDT

Adult: Single 5 mg IV infusion over 15 minutes, in conjunction with 1500 mg elemental calcium daily in divided doses and 800 IU vitamin D daily, especially in the 2 wk following zoledronic acid admin.

Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women
Adult: Single 5 mg IV infusion over at least 15 minutes, once a year.

Renal impairment:
CrCl (ml/min)	
<40 	Not recommended.

Patients with renal impairment
The use of Zolenic in patients with creatinine clearance <35 mL/min is not recommended due to limited clinical safety data in such patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance >35 mL/min.

Patients with hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment.



Contra-indication: The drug is contraindicated if patients have hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates, hypocalcaemia, renal impairment (creatinine clearance <35 mL/min), current or recent uveitis, or a history of bisphosphonate-associated uveitis, pregnancy and lactation. 

Side effects: The post-dose side-effects are fever, myalgia, flu-like symptoms, arthralgia and headache, the majority of which occur within the first 3 days following Zolenic administration. The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate in nature and resolved within 3 days of the event onset. The incidence of these symptoms occurring within the first 3 days after administration of Zolenic, can be reduced with the administration of Paracetamol or Ibuprofen shortly following Zolenic administration. Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking Zolenic.

Precaution: Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Zolenic. This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy. Adequate hydration can be achieved by the patient drinking two glasses of fluid (such as water) before and after the infusion. Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of Calcium and Vitamin-D before initiating therapy with Zolenic. Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated (e.g. diminished parathyroid reserve, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, intestinal Calcium malabsorption). Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients.

Mode of action: Zoledronic acid, an aminobiphosphonate, is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption. It inhibits osteoclastic activity and skeletal calcium release caused by tumours.

Pregnancy category: D

Patient Counseling Patients should be warned about performing activities involving mental alertness or physical coordination after drug intake.

Mode of action: Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine derivative that acts by binding to the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors of the GABA receptor complex resulting in neuronal hyperpolarisation, action potential inhibition, increased in chloride conductance and decreased in neuronal excitability. It has strong sedative action but only minimal anxiolytic, myorelaxant and anticonvulsant properties due to its selectivity for the BZ1-receptor over the BZ2-receptor. Zolpidem has a rapid onset but short duration of hypnotic action.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Flumazenil reverses the sedative/hypnotic effect of zolpidem. Increased depressant effects w/ CNS depressants (e.g. sedatives, antihistamines, alcohol). Additive effect on decreased alertness and psychomotor performance w/ imipramine and chlorpromazine. Increased plasma concentration w/ itraconazole, ketoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors. May decrease plasma concentration w/ CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine). Reduced hypnotic effect w/ rifampicin.
Potentially Fatal: Increased risk of prolonged sedation and respiratory depression w/ ritonavir.ACI	Hypnoclone TAB dr 7.5mg 20's pack 90.57 BDT

Mode of action: Zuclopenthixol has high affinity for D1 and D2 receptors and ?-adrenoreceptors. It also has slight antihistamine properties and blocks serotonergic properties.

Pregnancy category: C

Interaction: Zuclopenthixol may enhance the sedative effects of alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. Zuclopenthixol reduces the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine. Concomitant use of metoclopramide and piperazine with zuclopenthixol increases the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Increased risk of severe neurotoxicity with lithium and sibutramine. Increased anticholinergic side effects with drugs with anticholinergic properties.

Potentially Fatal: Antagonises effect of apomorphine, levodopa and other dopamine agonists. Increased risk of blood dyscrasias with clozapine. Increased risk of arrhythmias with dugs that prolong QT interval e.g. class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, erythromycin or cause electrolyte disturbances e.g. thiazide diuretics.
