Amino Acids 5 % & 10%	\nDrug International Ltd.\tNutrilive IV Infusion   500 ml bot 350\nindication\nP\nDose\nAdults:\n\nThe nitrogen requirement for maintenance of body protein mass depends on the patient's condition (nutritional state and degree of metabolic stress).\nNo or minor metabolic stress and normal nutritional state: 0.10-0.15 g nitrogen/kg/day,\nModerate metabolic stress with or without malnutrition: 0.15-0.20 g nitrogen/kg/day,\nSevere catabolism as in burns, sepsis and trauma: up to 0.20-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day.\n\nThe dosage range 0.10-0.25 g nitrogen/kg/day corresponds to 15-35 ml amino acid IV/kg/day.\nIn obese patients, the dose should be based on the estimated ideal weight. Depending upon patients requirements, 1000-2000 ml amino acid may be infused intravenously per 24 hours. It should be infused slowly, at rates 1.4-2.8 ml (30-60 drops) per minute.\n\nInfants and Children:\nIn children and infants, the rate of infusion is 28-35 ml/kg body wt/day is recommended, with a stepwise increment in the rate of administration during the first week of treatment.\nContra-indication\nContraindicated in patients with inborn errors of amino acids metabolism. Moreover, amino acid should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.\nSide effects\nIt is usually well tolerated. Yet nausea, vomiting, flushing and sweating have been observed during infusion of amino acid IV at rates exceeding the recommended maximal rate. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Like all hypertonic infusion solution, thrombophlebitis may occur when peripheral veins are used. The incidence may be reduced by the simultaneous infusion of 10% fat emulsion. If it is infused to severely ill patients, premature infants, hyperphenylalaninemia may occur.\nPrecaution\nHyperphenylalaninemia has been noted in severely ill, premature infants. In these patients, monitoring of the phenylalanine levels is recommended and the infusion rate adjusted as needed.\nDo not use if the solution is turbid or contains particles. Discard any unused portion.\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n
Amino Acids 7 % + Glucose & Electrolytes 10 %	\nMarksman.\tClinosol Gold IV Infusion    500 ml bot 401.51\nindication\nP\nDose\nFor peripheral intravenous infusion, 1 to 1.5 g/kg/day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism. Infusion or ingestion of carbohydrate or lipid will not reduce the nitrogen sparing effect of intravenous amino acid infusions at this dose.\nAs with all intravenous fluid therapy, the primary aim is to provide sufficient water to compensate for insensible, urinary, and other fluid losses (nasogastric suction, fistula drainage, and diarrhea).  Infused at a rate of 45 mL/kg/day, will meet the fluid and amino acid requirements of the stable adult patient.\nAs reported in the literature, the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants, because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia.\nContra-indication\nThis preparation should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization.\nSide effects\n it can be infused through a peripheral vein paying great care to the possible occurrence of local reactions. Local reactions consisting of a warm sensation, erythema, phlebitis and thrombosis at the infusion site have occurred with peripheral intravenous infusion of amino acids; in such cases the infusion site should be changed promptly to another vein. Use of large peripheral veins, inline filters, and slower rates of infusion may reduce the incidence of local venous irritation. Electrolyte additives should be spread throughout the day. Irritating additive medications may need to be injected at another venous site.\n\nGeneralized flushing, fever and nausea have been reported during peripheral infusions of amino acid solutions.\nPrecaution\nSpecial care must be taken when administering glucose solutions to provide calories in diabetic or prediabetic patients. To control and minimize possible hyperglycemia and consequent glycosuria, it is desirable to monitor blood and urine glucose and, if necessary, add insulin.\n\nBecause of its antianabolic activity, concurrent administration of tetracycline may reduce the nitrogen sparing effects of infused amino acids.\n\nFeeding regimens which include amino acids should be used with caution in patients with history of renal disease, pulmonary disease, or with cardiac insufficiency so as to avoid excessive fluid accumulation.\n\nNitrogen intake should be carefully monitored in patients with impaired renal function.\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n

Adverse reactions that may be expected based on experience with other water-soluble vitamin compounds administered intravenously include: allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis; dermatological reactions including flushing, erythema and pruritus and CNS reactions including headache, dizziness and agitation etc.\nPrecaution\nFolic acid may mask the symptoms of pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurologic manifestations remain progressive. Administering folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia. Recommended doses are insufficient to correct severe vitamin deficiency states and may be insufficient in patients with markedly increased vitamin requirements. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), routine supplementation with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is recommended to prevent deficiency states and to obviate the need to speculate on individual vitamin status. Daily vitamin requirements must be calculated to avoid over dosage and toxic effects, especially with regards to vitamins A & D and particularly in pediatric patients. \n\nIn patients for whom total parenteral nutrition is continued for prolonged periods (months or years), periodic monitoring of blood vitamin levels should be considered. To prevent excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins and for reasons of safety, daily dosage should be administered over a number of hours. \nMode of action\nDecreased GI tract absorption with neomycin, aminosalicylic acid, H2-blockers and colchicine.

Iron + Folic acid + B Complex + Vitamin C + Zinc	\nReliance\tAlneed PLUS CAP   100'pack 350\nindication\nV\nDose\nAdults (persons over 12 years of age), One (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician. Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12.\nContra-indication\n Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms.\nSide effects\n Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, heartburn and vomiting) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Reducing the dose and administering it with meals will minimize these effects in the sensitive patient. Increasing fiber in the diet can relieve constipation. Iron may turn stools black. This is a harmless effect that is a result of unabsorbed iron. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Integra FTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Integra FTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime.\nPrecaution\nGeneral: Anemia is a manifestation that requires appropriate investigation to determine its cause or causes. No single regimen fits all cases and the status of the patient observed in follow-up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy. Periodic clinical and laboratory studies are considered essential. Blood examinations including hemoglobin and hematacrit should be done at the usual intervals to make certain that therapy is adequate. Use with care in the presence of peptic ulcer, regional enteritis, and ulcerative colitis. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg -0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.\nMode of action\nIron: Antacids may decrease the absorption of carbonyl iron.\n\nFolic acid: Antiepileptics, oral contraceptives, anti-TB drugs, alcohol, aminopterin, methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim and sulphonamides may result to decrease in serum folate contrations.

Atorvastatin	\nMedicon\tG-Atorvastatin TAB dr 10mg 30's pack 210.30\nindication\n \nDose\nOral\nMixed dyslipidaemia, Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, Nonfamilial hypercholesterolaemia\nAdult: Initially, 10 or 20 mg once daily, may be adjusted at 4-wk interval. May initiate 40 mg once daily in patients who require >45% reduction in LDL-cholesterol. Max: 80 mg/day.\n\nChild: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: 10-17 yr 10 mg once daily, may increase at intervals of at least 4 wk to max 20 mg/day.\nElderly: No dosage adjustment needed.\n\nAtorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. Therapy should be individualized according to goal of therapy and response. After initiation and/or upon titration of Atorvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the LDL-C levels should be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should total-C be used to monitor therapy. \n\nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage of Atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Atorvastatin should be used as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (eg, LDL apheresis) in these patients or if such treatments are unavailable. \n\nDosage in Patients with Renal Insufficiency: Renal disease does not affect the plasma concentrations or LDL-C reduction of atorvastatin; thus, dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction is not necessary. \n\nPediatric Use: Treatment experience in a pediatric population is limited to doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day for 1 year in 8 patients with homozygous FH. No clinical or biochemical abnormalities were reported in these patients. None of these patients was below 9 years of age. \n\nGeriatric Use: Treatment experience in adult’s age 70 years with doses of Atorvastatin up to 80 mg/day has been evaluated. The safety and efficacy of Atorvastatin in this population were similar to those of patients <70 years of age.\n\nContra-indication\nHypersensitivity, active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminase, porphyria, pregnancy, lactation.\nSide effects\nHeadache, flatulence, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, xerostomia, angioedema, myalgia, rash/pruritus, alopecia, allergy, infection, chest pain.Potentially Fatal: Thrombocytopenia. Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure.\nPrecaution\nPatients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. History of liver disease. Patients with risk factors for myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.

Bacitracin Zinc + Neomycin Sulphate + Polymixin B	\nMarksman.\tNeocin Plus Ointment   10gm  tube 30\nindication\nM\nDose\nApply the ointment in the affected eye every 3 or 4 hours, depending on the severity of the condition. Not more than 8 grams should be prescribed initially and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in precaution above.\nContra-indication\nNeomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate ophthalmic ointment is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including: epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates and bacitracin zinc with hydrocortisone acetate ophthalmic ointment is also contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components. Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components.\nSide effects\nAdverse reactions have occurred with corticosteroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the corticosteroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. The exact incidence is not known. Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredient are allergic sensitization reactions including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . \n\nMore serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. The reactions due to the corticosteroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.\n\nSecondary Infection: The development of the secondary ocular infection has occurred after use of combinations containing corticosteroids and antimicrobials. Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of a corticosteroid. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where corticosteroid treatment has been used . Local irritation on installation has been reported.\nPrecaution\n The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 8 grams should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. \n\nAs fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term corticosteroid applications, fungal invasion should be suspected in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. \n\nThere have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of topical ophthalmic products in multiple-dose containers which have been inadvertently contaminated by patients, most of whom had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. \n\nAllergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.\nMode of action\nBacitracin Zinc: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity when used with other nephrotoxic drugs. May enhance the action of neuromuscular-blocking agents.\n\nNeomycin Sulphate: Additive nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effect w/ other aminoglycosides (e.g. paromomycin), bacitracin, cisplatin, vancomycin, amphotericin B, polymyxin B, colistin and viomycin.

Procedural complications are rare, but may include aspiration pneumonitis, barium sulfate impaction, granuloma formation, intravasation, embolization and peritonitis following intestinal perforation, vasovagal and syncopal episodes, and fatalities. It is of the utmost importance to be completely prepared to treat any such occurrence.\nPrecaution\nDiagnostic procedures which involve the use of radiopaque contrast agents should be carried out under the direction of personnel with the requisite training and with a thorough knowledge of the particular procedure to be performed. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, as evidenced by hay fever and eczema, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent, warrant special attention. Caution should be exercised with the use of radiopaque media in severely debilitated patients and in those with marked hypertension or advanced cardiac disease.\n\nIngestion of this product is not recommended in patients with a history of food aspiration. If barium studies are required in these patients or in patients in whom integrity of the swallowing mechanism is unknown, proceed with caution. If this product is aspirated into the larynx, further administration should be immediately discontinued.\n\nAfter any barium study of the GI tract, it is important to rehydrate the patient as quickly as possible to prevent impaction of the bowel by barium sulfate. To prevent barium sulfate impaction in the bowel, the use of mild laxatives such as milk of magnesia or lactulose, following completion of the examination may also be required. These mild laxatives are recommended on a routine basis and in patients with a history of constipation unless contraindicated.\n\nUse with caution in patients with complete or nearly complete obstruction of the GI tract.\nMode of action\n\nPregnancy categoryNot Classified\ninteraction\n

It is also contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Colecalciferol (or medicines of the same class) and any of the constituent excipients. Colecalciferol is contraindicated if there is evidence of vitamin D toxicity.\nSide effects\nGenerally all nutritional supplements are considered to be safe and well tolerable. However, few side-effects can generally occur including hypercalcaemia syndrome or Calcium intoxication (depending on the severity and duration of hypercalcaemia), occasional acute symptoms include anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or stomach ache and constipation with the administration of Colecaciferol.\nPrecaution\nPeople with the following conditions should exercise caution when considering taking vitamin D supplements:\nHigh blood Calcium or Phosphorus level\nHeart problems\nKidney disease\n\nVitamin D must be taken with adequate amounts of both Calcium and Magnesium supplementation. When Calcium level is low (due to insufficient vitamin D and calcium intake), the body activates the parathyroid gland, which produces PTH (parathyroid hormone). This hormone kick starts vitamin D hormone production and assists removal of Calcium from the bones to be used in more important functions such as neutralizing body acidity.\nMode of action\nIncreased risk of hypercalcaemia if given with thiazide diuretics, calcium or phosphate.

Thus, loading doses or bolus injections are not necessary and are not recommended. \n\nRecommended Dosage The rate of infusion needed to increase cardiac output has ranged from 2.5 to 10 mcg/kg/min in the majority of patients. Frequently, doses up to 20 mcg/kg/min are required for adequate haemodynamic improvement. \n\nThe rate of administration and the duration of therapy should be adjusted according to the patient's response, The indicators are: haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and rhythm, arterial pressure, and, whenever possible, cardiac output and measurements of ventricular filling pressures and signs of pulmonary congestion. \n\nConcentrations up to 5,000 mg/L have been administered to humans. The final volume administered should be determined by the fluid requirements of the patient. Rather than abruptly discontinuing therapy with Dobutamine Hydrochloride, it is often advisable to decrease the dosage gradually. Rates of Infusion Based on Concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride The rates of fluid infusion that are required to deliver specific dosages are a function of the concentration of Dobutamine Hydrochloride in the infusate.\n\nContra-indication\nHypersensitivity; idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS).\nSide effects\nIncreased heart rate and BP, ectopic beats, palpitation. Nausea, headache, chest pain, palpitation, dyspnoea, paraesthesia, leg cramps.

Hydrocortisone Acetate 2.5% + Pramoxine 1% Topical	\nApex\tPracort Cream    55\nindication\nH\nDose\nTopical corticosteroids are generally applied to the affected area as a thin film three to four times daily depending on the severity of the condition. Occlusive dressings may be used for the management of psoriasis or recalcitrant conditions. If an infection develops, the use of occlusive dressings should be discontinued and appropriate antimicrobial therapy instituted.\nContra-indication\nTopical corticosteroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation.\nSide effects\n If the drug is absorbed in the system patient may feel blurred vision, halos around lights, irregular heart rate, insomnia. Redness, burning, itching and irritation may occur in application site.\nPrecaution\nSystemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings.\n\nTherefore, patients receiving a large dose of a potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area and under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests. If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.\n\nRecovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity.  \n\nIf irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.\n\nIn the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n
Hydroquinone	\nReliance\tSpotclen Cream 4% 10gm pack 50\nindication\nC\nDose\nHydroquinone should be applied to the affected area and rubbed in well twice daily or as directed by a physician. Most discolorations begin to lighten after 4 weeks of treatment but it may take longer. After desired bleaching, use only as needed to maintain results of treatment. Hydroquinone bleaching is faster, more dependable and easier if the treated area is protected from ultraviolet light. Therefore, exposure to sunlight should be minimized at the period of treatment. During day, an effective broad-spectrum sunscreen should be used, unnecessary solar exposure should be avoided and protective clothing should be used to prevent repigmentation of treated areas. After reduction of hyperpigmentation, use of sunscreen agents and/or protective clothing should continue.Use in children: Safety and efficacy in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.\nContra-indication\nHydroquinone is contraindicated to patients with prior history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to hydroquinone or other ingredients in the preparation.\nSide effects\nNo systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur in which case the medication should be discontinued.\nPrecaution\nHydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin to check in 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response, further treatment is not advised. If no bleaching or lightening effect is noted after 2 months of treatment, the medication should be discontinued.Contact with the eyes and lips should be avoided. Hydroquinone should not be applied to cut or abraded skin.\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n

Hydroxocobalamin	\nBeximco\tCynomin H Injection 1mg/ml 10 amps pack 70.30\nindication\nV\nDose\nThirty mcg daily for 5 to 10 days followed by 100 to 200 mcg monthly injected intramuscularly. If the patient is critically ill, or has neurologic disease, an infectious disease or hyperthyroidism, considerably higher doses may be indicated. However, current data indicate that the optimum obtainable neurologic response may be expected with a dosage of vitamin B12 sufficient to produce good hematologic response. Children may be given a total of 1 to 5 mg over a period of 2 or more weeks in doses of 100 mcg, then 30 to 50 mcg every 4 weeks for maintenance.\nContra-indication\nHypersensitivity to any component of this medication.\nSide effects\nMild transient diarrhea, itching, transitory exanthema, feeling of swelling of entire body, and anaphylaxis.\n\nA few patients may experience pain after injection of hydroxocobalamin.\nPrecaution\nGeneral\n\nThe validity of diagnostic vitamin B12 or folic acid blood assays could be compromised by medications, and this should be considered before relying on such tests for therapy.\n\nVitamin B12 is not a substitute for folic acid and since it might improve folic acid deficient megaloblastic anemia, indiscriminate use of vitamin B12 could mask the true diagnosis.\n\nHypokalemia and thrombocytosis could occur upon conversion of severe megaloblastic to normal erythropoiesis with B12 therapy. Therefore, serum potassium levels and the platelet count should be monitored carefully during therapy.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency may suppress the signs of polycythemia vera. Treatment with vitamin B12 may unmask this condition.\nMode of action\nhistory of interaction with ARI Sodium Iodide (I123) 1-12 MBq (sodium iodide i-123)\nARI Sodium Iodide (I123) 100-750 MBq (sodium iodide i-123)\narsenic trioxide\nChloracol (chloramphenicol)\nchloramphenicol\nChloromycetin (chloramphenicol)\nChloromycetin Sodium Succinate (chloramphenicol)\nHicon (sodium iodide-i-131)\nIodotope (sodium iodide-i-131)\nsodium iodide i-123\nsodium iodide-i-131\nTrisenox (arsenic trioxide)\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\nhistory of interaction with ARI Sodium Iodide (I123) 1-12 MBq (sodium iodide i-123)\nARI Sodium Iodide (I123) 100-750 MBq (sodium iodide i-123)\narsenic trioxide\nChloracol (chloramphenicol)\nchloramphenicol\nChloromycetin (chloramphenicol)\nChloromycetin Sodium Succinate (chloramphenicol)\nHicon (sodium iodide-i-131)\nIodotope (sodium iodide-i-131)\nsodium iodide i-123\nsodium iodide-i-131\nTrisenox (arsenic trioxide)

Combined therapy of this type could lead to the appearance of serious interactions such as hypertensive crises, hyperactivity, hyperpyrexia, spasticity, severe convulsions or coma and death may occur. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients with existing severe hepatic or renal damage, and those with a history of blood dyscrasias. Imipramine is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug or hypersensitivity to tricyclic antidepressants belonging to the dibenzazepine group. Imipramine is contraindicated for use during the acute recovery phase following a myocardial infarction. It should not be used in patients with convulsive disorders or glaucoma. \nSide effects\nThe most frequent of side effects are dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, increased heart rate, sedation, irritability, dizziness, and decreased coordination. Dry mouth, if severe to the point of causing difficulty speaking or swallowing, may be managed by dosage reduction or temporary discontinuation of the drug. Imipramine usage has been linked to both increases and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and strokes have been reported. Confusion, disorientation, delusions, insomnia, and anxiety have also been reported as side effects in a small percentage of people taking imipramine. Problems associated with the skin (loss of sensation, numbness and tingling, rashes, spots, itching and puffiness), seizures, and ringing in the ears have also been reported. Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping are all side effects associated with imipramine usage in a small number of people.\nPrecaution\nImipramine should be used cautiously and with close physician supervision in people, especially the elderly, who have benign prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, and glaucoma, especially angle-closure glaucoma. The sedative effect is increased when imipramine is taken with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcoholic beverages, sleeping medications, other sedatives, or antihistamines. Imipramine may increase heart rate and stress on the heart. It may be dangerous for people with cardiovascular disease, especially those who have recently had a heart attack, to take this drug or other antidepressants in the same pharmacological class. Older people and persons with a history of heart disease may develop heart arrhythmias, heart conduction abnormalities, congestive heart failure, heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rates and strokes. Until a therapeutic dosage has been determined, people starting imipramine should be closely watched for signs of suicide. The risk of suicide is increased when imipramine is taken in overdose or combined with alcohol. Manic episodes and the emergence of symptoms of pre-existing psychotic states have been reported when imipramine therapy is started.\nMode of action\nIncreased plasma levels and effects with quinidine, cimetidine, SSRIs, propafenone, flecainide.

Metformin Hydrochloride + Pioglitazone	\nReliance\tCompimet 500 TAB dr   30's pack 270\nindication\nT\nDose\nDosage of this preparation must be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Pioglitazone 45 mg and Metformin 2550 mg.  \n\nIt may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg once daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.\n\nThe initial and maintenance dose of  it should be carefully selected in patients with advanced age due to the potential for decreased renal function in these populations. \n\nMonitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of Metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly.  It should not be initiated if the patients exhibit clinical evidence of active liver disease. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended in all patients prior to initiation of therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin and periodically thereafter. \nContra-indication\n1. Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g. as suggested by serum creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dl in male, >1.4 mg/dl in females or abnormal creatinine clearance), which may also result from conditions such as cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction and septicemia.\n2. Known hypersensitivity to Pioglitazone, Metformin or any other component of this combination.\n3. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without coma.\nSide effects\nGenerally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity.\nPrecaution\nPioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of insulin. Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases.\n\nMetformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive this combination.\nMode of action\nAdditive effect w/ sulfonylureas. Thiazide diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, OC, sympathomimetics, niacin, Ca channel blockers and isoniazid may exacerbate loss of glycaemic control. ACE inhibitors may reduce fasting blood glucose concentrations.

The dose may be increased by increment of 2 mg/500 mg per day to a maximum of 8 mg/2,000 mg per day in divided doses if patients are not adequately controlled after 4 weeks.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy, the usual starting dose  is 4 mg Rosiglitazone (daily dose) plus the dose of Metformin already being taken.\n\nFor patients inadequately controlled on Rosiglitazone monotherapy, the usual starting dose is 1000 mg Metformin (daily dose) plus the dose of Rosiglitazone already being taken.\n\nWhen switching from combination therapy of Rosiglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets, the usual starting dose  is the dose of Rosiglitazone and Metformin already being taken. If additional glycemic control is needed, the daily dose may be increased by increment of 4 mg Rosiglitazone and/or 500 mg Metformin, up to the maximum recommended total daily dose of 8 mg/2000 mg.\nContra-indication\nIt is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by serum creatinine levels .1.5 mg/dl (males), 1.4 mg/dl (females), or abnormal creatinine clearance), acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma & known hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone maleate or metformin HCl.\nSide effects\nRosiglitazone: The commonly reported adverse events are upper respiratory tract infections, injury, headache, back pain, fatigue, sinusitis, diarrhoea and hypoglycemia. There were a small number of patients who had anemia and edema. All these events were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment with Rosiglitazone.\nMetformin: Some patients may develop asymptomatic subnormal levels of serum vitamin B12.\nIncidence of lactic acidosis is also very rare. Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating, flatulence and anorexia are common reactions to Metformin.\nPrecaution\nRosiglitazone: should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. This should be used with caution in patients with edema. Dose-related weight gain was seen with rosiglitazone alone and rosiglitazone together with other hypoglycemic agents.\n\nMetformin: Monitoring of renal function: Patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal should not receive this tablet. In patients with advanced age, the dose should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. \nMode of action\nAdditive effect w/ sulfonylureas.

Methylprednisolone Acetate	\nReliance\tCortan M Injection 40 mg/ml  \nindication\nC\nDose\nThe initial dosage of parenterally administered Methyl Prednisolone Acetate will vary from 4 to 120 mg, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administration in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.\n\nIt Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\n\nA. Administration for Local Effect\n\n1. Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis. The dose for intra-articular administration depends upon the size of the joint and varies with the severity of the condition in the individual patient. In chronic cases, injections may be repeated at intervals ranging from one to five or more weeks, depending upon the degree of relief obtained from the initial injection. The doses in the following table are given as a general guide:\n\nLarge Joint: Knees, Ankles & Shoulders:	20 to 80 mg\nMedium joint: Elbows & Wrists:	 10 to 40 mg\nSmall joint:  Metacarpophalangeal, Interphalangeal, Sternoclavicular & Acromioclavicular:  4 to 10 mg\n\n2. The dose in the treatment of the various conditions of the tendinous or bursal structures varies with the condition being treated and ranges from 4 to 30 mg. In recurrent or chronic conditions, repeated injections may be necessary.\n\n3. Injections for Local Effect in Dermatologic Conditions. Following cleansing with an appropriate antiseptic such as 70% alcohol, 20 to 60 mg of the suspension is injected into the lesion. It may be necessary to distribute doses ranging from 20 to 40 mg by repeated local injections in the case of large lesions. \n\nB. Administration for Systemic Effect\n\nThe intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of methylprednisolone tablets is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.\n\nIn pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. The recommended dosage may be reduced for pediatric patients, but dosage should be governed by the severity of the condition rather than by strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.\n\nIn patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.\n\nFollowing intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks. Similarly, in patients with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks.\n\nIf signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.\n\nIn treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\n\nContra-indication\nMethylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents.\n\nIntramuscular corticosteroid preparations are contraindicated for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nMethylprednisolone acetate injectable suspension is contraindicated for intrathecal administration. This formulation of methylprednisolone acetate has been associated with reports of severe medical events when administered by this route.\n\nMethylprednisolone acetate is contraindicated in systemic fungal infections, except when administered as an intra-articular injection for localized joint conditions\nSide effects\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported with methylprednisolone acetate or other corticosteroids:\n\nAllergic Reactions\n\nAllergic or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis, angioedema.\n\nCardiovascular\n\nBradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, circulatory collapse, congestive heart failure, fat embolism, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopthy in premature infants, myocardial rupture following recent mycocardial infarction , pulmonary edema, syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis.\n\nDermatologic\n\nAcne, allergic dermatitis, cutaneous and subcutaneous atrophy, dry scaly skin, ecchymoses and petechiae, edema, erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, impaired wound healing, increase sweating, rash, sterile abscess, striae, suppressed reactions to skin tests, thin fragile skin, thinning scalp hair, urticaria.\n\nEndocrine\n\nDecreased carbohydrate and glucose tolerance, development of cushingoid state, glycosuria, hirsutism, hypertrichosis, increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetes, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, menstrual irregularities, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness (particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery, or illness), suppression of growth in pediatric patients.\n\nFluid and Electrolyte Disturbances\n\nCongestive heart failure in susceptible patients, Fluid retention, hypokalemic alkalosis, potassium loss, sodium retention.\n\nGastrointestinal\n\nAbdominal distention, bowel/bladder dysfunction (after intrathecal administration), elevation in serum liver enzymes levels (usually reversible upon discontinuation), hepatomegaly, increased appetite, nausea, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer with possible subsequent perforation and hemorrhage, perforation of the small and large intestine (particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease), ulcerative esophagitis.\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\nAseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, calcinosis (following intra-articular or intra-lesional use), Charcot-like arthropathy, loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, pathologic fracture of long bones, postinjection flare (following intra-articular use), steroid myopathy, tendon rupture, vertebral compression fractures.\n\nNeurologic/Psychiatric\n\nConvulsions, depression, emotional instability, euphoria, headache, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri) usually following discontinuation of treatment, insomnia, mood swings, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia, personality changes, psychic disorders, vertigo.\n\nOphthalmic\n\nExophthalmoses, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, posterior subcapsular cataracts.\n\n\n\n\nPrecaution\nGeneral\n\nThe lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment.

Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate	\nAmbee\tMelpred IV/IM Injection 1 gm/vial  \nindication\n \nDose\nThis preparation may be administered by intravenous injection, by intravenous infusion, or by intramuscular injection, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation.\n\nWhen high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours.\n\nIn general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.\n\nIn other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.\n\nIt should be emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. \nIf after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\n\nTo prepare solutions for intravenous infusion, first prepare the solution for injection as directed. This solution may then be added to indicate amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution.\n\nIn pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).\n\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.\n\nDosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.\n\nIn treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.\n\nContra-indication\nPowder is also contraindicated in systemic fungal infections and patients with known hypersensitivity to the product and its constituents.

Neomycin Sulphate 0.5% + Prednisolone 0.5% E/E prep	\nSupreme\tDeltasone N Eye/Ear Drops   5  ml drop 39.98\nindication\nB\nDose\n Instill 1 or 2 drops every 3 or 4 hours, or more frequently as required. Acute infections may require administration every 30 minutes, with frequency of administration reduced as the infection is brought under control. \n\n\nContra-indication\nEpithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, varicella, and many other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva. Mycobacterial infection of the eye. Fungal diseases of the ocular structures. Hypersensitivity to a component of the medication. (Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components.)\n\nThe use of these combinations is always contraindicated after uncomplicated removal of a corneal foreign body.\nSide effects\nAdverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Exact incidence figures are not available since no denominator of treated patients is available.\n\nReactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti-infective ingredients are allergic sensitizations including itching, swelling, and conjunctival erythema . More serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported rarely. The reactions due to the steroid component in decreasing order of frequency are: elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) with possible development of glaucoma, and infrequent optic nerve damage; posterior subcapsular cataract formation; and delayed wound healing.\n\nAlthough systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurences of systemic hypercorticoidism after use of topical steroids.\n\nCorticosteroid-containing preparations have also been reported to cause perforation of the globe. Keratitis, conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, and conjunctival hyperemia have occasionally been reported following local use of steroids.\n\nSecondary infection: The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used.\n\nSecondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs.\nPrecaution\nThe initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 20 milliliters should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining.\n\nThe possibility of persistent fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged steroid dosing.\n\nAs with other antimicrobial preparations, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, appropriate therapy should be initiated.\n\n . If purulent discharge, inflammation, or pain becomes aggravated, the patient should discontinue use of the medicatioin and consult a physician.\n\nAllergic cross-reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections: kanamycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and possibly gentamicin.\nMode of action\nSynergistic effects with penicillins. Additive toxicity with neurotoxic, ototoxic or nephrotoxic drugs. May decrease absorption of digoxin and methotrexate. May increase effects of oral anticoagulants.\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\nSynergistic effects with penicillins. Additive toxicity with neurotoxic, ototoxic or nephrotoxic drugs.

May also be given by IM or slow IV inj.\n\nHyperlipidaemias\nAdult: As immediate-release preparation: Initially, 600 mg daily in 3 divided doses, gradually increased over 2-4 wk to max 6 g daily (usual dose 1-2 g bid-tid). As modified-release preparation: Initially, 375 or 500 mg at night gradually increased by no more that 500 mg in 4 wk according to patient's response. Maintenance: 1-2 g at bedtime.\n\nVasodilation\nAdult: As immediate-release preparation: 100-150 mg 3-5 times daily. As extended release preparation: 300-400 mg 12 hrly.\n\n\nContra-indication\nNiacin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to Niacin or any component of this medication, significant or unexplained hepatic dysfunction, active peptic ulcer disease or arterial bleeding.\nSide effects\nNiacin is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions have been mild and transient.The most frequent advers effects were flushing, itching, pruritis, nausea and GI upset, jaundice ,hypotension, tachycardia, increased serum blood glucose and uric acid levels, myalgia.\nPrecaution\nBefore instituting therapy with Niacin, an attempt should be made to control hyperlipidemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight reduction in obese patients and to treat other underlying medical problems. Patients with a past history of jaundice, hepatobiliary disease, or peptic ulcer should be observed closely during Niacin therapy. Frequent monitoring of liver function tests and blood glucose should be performed to ascertain that the drug is producing no adverse effects on these organ systems. Diabetic patients may experience a dose-related rise in glucose intolerance, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Diabetic or potentially diabetic patients should be observed closely. Adjustment of diet and/or hypoglycemic therapy may be necessary.\n\nCaution should also be used when Niacin is used in patients with unstable angina or in the acute phase of MI, particularly when such patients are also receiving vasoactive drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers or adrenergic blocking agents. Elevated uric acid levels have occurred with Niacin therapy, therefore use with caution in patients predisposed to gout. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant dose-related reductions in platelet count and increases in prothrombin time. Caution should be observed when Niacin is administered concomitantly with anticoagulants; prothrombin time and platelet counts should be monitored closely in such patients. Niacin has been associated with small but statistically significant, dose-related reductions in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg). So phosphorus levels should be monitored periodically in patients at risk.\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n

Not to exceed 32 milliunits/minute and no more than a total of 5 units should be given in 1 day. Not to be given within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Monitor uterine contractions and foetal heart rate continuously. Withdraw gradually once labour is progressing.\n\nOxytocin challenge test for evaluating of foetal distress\nAdult: Dilute 5-10 units in 1 L of 5% dextrose inj. Initially, administer the drug in the mother via IV infusion at a rate of 0.5 milliunits/minute. May gradually increase infusion rate at intervals of 15-30 minutes. Max: 20 milliunits/minute. Monitor foetal heart rate and uterine contractions immediately before and during infusion. Discontinue infusion when 3 moderate uterine contractions occur within one 10-minute interval. Compare baseline and oxytocin-induced foetal heart rates. If no change occurs, repeat the test in 1 wk. Termination of pregnancy may be required if a late deceleration in foetal heart rate occurs.\nContra-indication\nCephalopelvic disproportion; abnormal presentation of the foetus; hydraminios; multiparae; previous caesarian section or other uterine surgery; hyperactive or hypertonic uterus, uterine rupture; contraindicated vaginal delivery (invasive cervical cancer, active genital herpes, prolapse of the cord, cord presentation, total placenta previa or vasa previa); foetal distress where delivery is not imminent; severe pre-eclamptic toxaemia.\nSide effects\nFoetus or neonate: Jaundice; arrhythmias, bradycardia; brain, CNS damage; seizure; retinal haemorrhage; low Apgar score. Mother: transient hypotension, reflex tachycardia; nasal irritation, rhinorrhoea, lachrymation (following nasal admin); uterine bleeding, violent contractions, hypertonicity; spasm; nausea, vomiting.\nPotentially Fatal: Maternal water intoxication (especially with slow infusion over 24 hr); prolonged uterine contractions causing foetal hypoxia and death; rupture of gravid uterus; afibrinogenaemia; subarachnoid haemorrhage\nPrecaution\nCV disorders; >35 yr; lactation. Monitor foetal and maternal heart rate, maternal BP and uterine motility. Monitor fluid intake and output during treatment. Discontinute immediately if the uterus is hypertonic or hyperactive or if there is foetal distress. Use of nasal spray may produce maternal dependence on its effects. IM admin not regularly used due to unpredictable effects of oxytocin. Not to be used for prolonged periods in resistant uterine inertia, severe pre-eclampsia, or severe CV disorders. Risk of water intoxication when used at high doses for prolonged periods.\nMode of action\nPossible severe hypertension if given within 3-4 hr of vasoconstrictor in association with a caudal block anaesthesia. Cyclopropane anaesthesia may increase risk of hypotension and maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal AV rhythms. Dinoprostone and misoprostol may increase uterotonic effect of oxytocin, thus oxytocin should not be used within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins. Concurrent use may increase the vasopressor effect of sympathomimetics.\n\nPotentially Fatal: Concomitant use with prostaglandins increases risk of uterine rupture and cervical lacerations.\nPregnancy categoryX\ninteraction\nPossible severe hypertension if given within 3-4 hr of vasoconstrictor in association with a caudal block anaesthesia. Cyclopropane anaesthesia may increase risk of hypotension and maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal AV rhythms. Dinoprostone and misoprostol may increase uterotonic effect of oxytocin, thus oxytocin should not be used within 6 hr after admin of vaginal prostaglandins.

Proparacaine Hydrochloride 0.5%	\nGlobe\tP-caine Eye Drops 0.5% 10 ml plastic dropper bottle \nindication\nC\nDose\nDeep anesthesia as in cataract extraction:\n\nInstill 1 drop every 5 to 10 minutes for 5 to 7 doses.\n\nRemoval of sutures:\n\nInstill 1 or 2 drops 2 or 3 minutes before removal of stitches.\n\nRemoval of foreign bodies:\n\nInstill 1 or 2 drops prior to operating.\n\nTonometry:\n\nInstill 1 or 2 drops immediately before measurement.\n\nContra-indication\nThis preparation is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the solution. This product should never be prescribed for the patient's own use.\nSide effects\nPupillary dilatation or cycloplegic effects have rarely been observed with proparacaine hydrochloride. The drug appears to be safe for use in patients sensitive to other local anesthetics, but local or systemic sensitivity occasionally occurs. Instillation of proparacaine in the eye at recommended concentration and dosage usually produces little or no initial irritation, stinging, burning, conjunctival redness, lacrimation or increased winking. However, some local irritation and stinging may occur several hours after the instillation. Rarely, a severe immediate-type, apparently hyperallergic corneal reaction may occur which includes acute, intense and diffuse epithelial keratitis; a gray, ground-glass appearance; sloughing of large areas of necrotic epithelium; corneal filaments and, sometimes, iritis with descemetitis. Allergic contact dermatitis with drying and fissuring of the fingertips has been reported. Softening and erosion of the corneal epithelium and conjunctival congestion and hemorrhage have been reported.\nPrecaution\nProparacaine hydrochloride should be used cautiously and sparingly in patients with known allergies, cardiac disease, or hyperthyroidism. The long-term toxicity of proparacaine is unknown, prolonged use may possibly delay wound healing. Although exceedingly rare with ophthalmic application of local anesthetics, it should be borne in mind that systemic toxicity (manifested by central nervous system stimulation followed by depression) may occur. Protection of the eye from irritating chemicals, foreign bodies and rubbing during the period of anesthesia is very important. Tonometers soaked in sterilizing or detergent solutions should be thoroughly rinsed with sterile distilled water prior to use. Patients should be advised to avoid touching the eye until the anesthesia has worn off.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n\nLong-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenicity, or possible impairment oi fertility in males or females.\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n

Allergic reactions, liver enzyme abnormalities, hypotension. Potentially Fatal: Haemorrhage; anaphylactic shock.\nPrecaution\nMitral stenosis associated with AF. Streptokinase treatment within last 12 mth, use after prolonged or traumatic CPR; diabetic retinopathy. Elderly. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, due to antistreptokinase antibodies, retreatment with Streptokinase or Streptokinase-containing products may not be effective if administered between five days and twelve months of prior Streptokinase administration or Streptococcal infections, such as Streptococcal pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis secondary to a Streptococcal infection. In principle, no thrombolytic treatment should be commenced before the 10th postoperative day. However, in cases of pulmonary embolism, the indication for earlier treatment may be very strong and after careful consideration of all the risks, Streptokinase may be given before the tenth postoperative day. The danger of bleeding from the operative area must, of course, be taken into account. The danger of haemorrhage is increased by simultaneous or previous treatment with anticoagulants (e.g., Heparin) or substances which inhibit platelet formation or function. If the patient is under active heparinisation, it should be neutralised by the administration of protamine sulphate before the start of thrombolytic therapy.  Repeated Administration After administration of Streptokinase, the titre of antistreptokinase antibodies begins to rise after approximately one week, reaching a peak at 2 to 3 weeks and remains elevated for 8 to 12 months. Because of the increased likelihood of resistance, Streptokinase may not be effective if given during this period.\nMode of action\nAntagonistic effects with antifibrinolytic agents e.g. aminocaproic acid.\nPotentially Fatal: Anticoagulants, heparin, antiplatelet agents e.g. aspirin and dipyridamole affect platelet function increasing the risk of haemorrhage.\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\nAntagonistic effects with antifibrinolytic agents e.g. aminocaproic acid.\nPotentially Fatal: Anticoagulants, heparin, antiplatelet agents e.g. aspirin and dipyridamole affect platelet function increasing the risk of haemorrhage.

Usual maintenance dose: 2-10 mg daily.\nElderly: Lower initial dose.\nHepatic impairment: Severe: Avoid.\n\n\nContra-indication\n1. Actual or potential haemorrhagic conditions, eg. Peptic ulcer, or to patients with uncontrolled hypertension\n2. Severe hepatic or renal disease\n3. Pregnancy\n4. Known hypersensitivity to warfarin\n5. Bacterial endocarditis\nIts use within 24 hours following surgery or labour should be undertaken with caution, if at all.\nSide effects\nHemorrhage is the principal adverse effect of oral anticoagulants. Other adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersensitivity, rash, alopecia, and unexplained drop in haematocrit, "purple toes", skin necrosis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction.\nPrecaution\nPeriodic determination of prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) or other suitable coagulation test is essential. Numerous factors, alone or in combination, including travel, changes in diet, environment, physical state and medication may influence response of the patient to anticoagulants. It is generally good practice to monitor the patient's response with additional PT/INR determination in the period immediately after discharge from the hospital, and whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued or taken irregularly. \n\nThe following factors may exaggerate the effects of warfarin and necessitate a reduction in dosage; loss of weight, elderly subject, acute illness, deficient renal function, decreased dietary intake of vitamin K, administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Factors which may call for an increase in maintenance dosage include weight gain, diarrhea and vomiting, increased intake of vitamin K, fats and oils, and the administration of certain drugs (see drug interaction). Careful additional laboratory control is necessary if the patient is to be changed from one formulation to another. Reversal of warfarin anticoagulation by vitamin K takes several days. In emergency situations fresh frozen plasma should be given.\nMode of action\nCholestatic hepatitis may occur when taken concomitantly w/ ticlopidine.

Continue the same dose once or twice daily for up to 7 days or until adequate wound healing is achieved.\n\nLife-threatening hemorrhage:(Major surgery, Gastrointestinal bleeding, Neck, tongue, or pharyngeal hematoma (with potential for airway compromise) , Intracranial, intraabdominal, or intrathoracic bleeding, Fractures)\n\nInitially 40-50 IU FVIII:C/kg, followed by 20-25 IU FVIII:C/kg every 8 hours to maintain the FVIII:C plasma level at 80-100% of normal for 7 days. Continue the same dose once or twice daily for another 7 days to maintain the FVIII:C level at 30-50% of normal.\n\nContra-indication\nIn individuals who have had an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to antihemophilic factor or von Willebrand factor preparations.\nSide effects\nThe most serious adverse reaction observed in patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII is anaphylaxis. Thromboembolic events have also been observed in patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII for the treatment of VWD . Reports of thromboembolic events in VWD patients with other thrombotic risk factors receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy have been obtained from spontaneous reports, published literature, and a European clinical study. In some cases, inhibitors to coagulation factors may occur. However, no inhibitor formation was observed in any of the clinical studies.\n\nIn patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor VIII in clinical studies for treatment of VWD, the most commonly reported adverse reactions observed by >5% of subjects are allergic-anaphylactic reactions (including urticaria, chest tightness, rash, pruritus, and edema). For patients undergoing surgery, the most common adverse reactions are postoperative wound and injection-site bleeding, and epistaxis.\nPrecaution\n5.1 Thromboembolic Events (VWD Patients)\n\nThromboembolic events have been reported in VWD patients receiving Antihemophilic Factor/von Willebrand Factor Complex replacement therapy, especially in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis.3,4 Early reports indicate a higher incidence may occur in females. Endogenous high levels of FVIII have also been associated with thrombosis, but no causal relationship has been established. Exercise caution and consider antithrombotic measures in all at-risk VWD patients who are receiving coagulation factor replacement therapy.\n\n5.2 Monitoring for Intravascular Hemolysis\n\nThis contains blood group isoagglutinins (anti-A and anti-B). When doses are very large or need to be repeated frequently (for example, when inhibitors are present or when pre- and post-surgical care is involved), monitor patients of blood groups A, B, and AB for signs of intravascular hemolysis and decreasing hematocrit values and treat appropriately.\n\n5.3 Monitoring VWF:RCo and FVIII Levels\n\nMonitor the VWF: RCo and FVIII levels of VWD patients receiving this medicine using standard coagulation tests, especially in cases of surgery. It is advisable to monitor trough VWF:RCo and FVIII:C levels at least once a day in order to adjust the dosage of this as needed to avoid excessive accumulation of coagulation factors \n\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n

Sensitization to repeated injections of human immunoglobulin is extremely rare.\n\nIn the course of routine injections of large numbers of persons with immunoglobulin there have been a few isolated occurrences of angioneurotic edema, nephrotic syndrome, and anaphylactic shock after injection.\nPrecaution\nIntravenous injection of immunoglobulin intended for intramuscular use can, on occasion, cause a precipitous fall in blood pressure, and a picture not unlike anaphylaxis. Injections should only be made intramuscularly and care should be taken to draw back on the plunger of the syringe before injection in order to be certain that the needle is not in a blood vessel. Intramuscular injections are preferably administered in the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or lateral thigh muscle. The gluteal region should not be used as an injection site because of the risk of injury to the sciatic nerve.\n\nChemoprophylaxis against tetanus is neither practical nor useful in managing wounds. Wound cleaning, debridement when indicated, and proper immunization are important. The need for tetanus toxoid (active immunization), with or without TIG (passive immunization), depends on both the condition of the wound and the patient’s vaccination history. Rarely has tetanus occurred among persons with documentation of having received a primary series of toxoid injections.\nMode of action\nMay reduce the efficacy of live vaccines.\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\nMay reduce the efficacy of live vaccines.

However, the presence of a minor infection eg, a cold should not result in the deferral of vaccination.\nUse in lactation: The effect on breastfed infants of the administration of Cervarix to their mothers has not been evaluated in clinical studies.\nCervarix should only be used during breastfeeding when the possible advantages outweigh the possible risks.\nSerological data suggest a transfer of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies via the milk during the lactation period in rats. However, it is unknown whether vaccine-induced antibodies are excreted in human breast milk.\nMode of action\nImmunosuppressive therapies e.g. irradiation, cytotoxic drugs and corticorsteroids may reduce a patient's immune response to the vaccine.\nPregnancy categoryB\ninteraction\nImmunosuppressive therapies e.g. irradiation, cytotoxic drugs and corticorsteroids may reduce a patient's immune response to the vaccine.
Human Rota Virus, Live attenuated Vaccine	\nEuro Pharma Ltd.\tRotarix Oral Vaccine  1.5 ml  1 ml vial with oral applicator 1548.50\nindication\nP\nDose\nThe vaccination course consists of two doses. The first dose should be given between 6 and 14 weeks of age. The interval between the two doses should not be less than 4 weeks. The vaccine course should be completed by the age of 24 weeks as safety has not been assessed in older children. In clinical trials, spitting or regurgitation of the vaccine has rarely been observed and, under such circumstances, a replacement dose was not given. However, in the unlikely event that an infant spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be given at the same vaccination visit.\nContra-indication\nSubjects with history of intussusception. Subjects with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, is not a contraindication for immunisation.\nSide effects\nRisk of intussusception has not been established. The overall incidence of intussusception remains rare.\nPrecaution\nIt is good clinical practice that vaccination should be preceded by a review of the medical history (especially with regard to previous vaccination and possible occurrence of undesirable events) and a clinical examination. Parents/guardians should be advised to seek medical advice promptly where these signs/symptoms are evident. There is a potential risk for transmission to non-vaccinated contacts. It should be administered with caution to infants with close contacts who are immunodeficient, such as household members with malignancies or who are otherwise immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Contacts of recent vaccinees should be advised to observe personal hygiene (e.g. washing their hands when changing childrenâ€™s nappies).\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n

Liraglutide	\nDelta Pharma\tVictoza Injection 3ml 1's  pack 7850\nindication\nT\nDose\nIt can be administered once daily at any time of day, independently of meals, and can be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment.\n\nFor all patients  should be initiated with a dose of 0.6 mg per day for one week. The 0.6 mg dose is a starting dose intended to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms during initial titration, and is not effective for glycemic control. After one week at 0.6 mg per day, the dose should be increased to 1.2 mg. If the 1.2 mg dose does not result in acceptable glycemic control, the dose can be increased to 1.8 mg.\n\nWhen initiating , consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia\nContra-indication\nDo not use in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).\n\nDo not use in patients with a prior serious hypersensitivity reaction to   any of the product components.\nSide effects\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\nPrecaution\nIn the clinical trials, there have been 6 reported cases of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia among Victoza-treated patients and 2 cases in comparator-treated patients (1.3 vs. 1.0 cases per 1000 patient-years). One comparator-treated patient with MTC had pre-treatment serum calcitonin concentrations >1000 ng/L suggesting pre-existing disease. All of these cases were diagnosed after thyroidectomy, which was prompted by abnormal results on routine, protocol-specified measurements of serum calcitonin. Five of the six Victoza-treated patients had elevated calcitonin concentrations at baseline and throughout the trial. One Victoza and one non-Victoza-treated patient developed elevated calcitonin concentrations while on treatment. \nMode of action\nOral Contraceptives: Liraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. Tmax was delayed by 1.5 hrs with liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of either ethinyloestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide.\n\nWarfarin: No interaction study has been performed. Upon initiation of Liraglutide treatment in patients on warfarin more frequent monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR) is recommended.\n\nInsulin: Combination of Liraglutide with insulin has not been evaluated.\n\nIncompatibilities: Substances added to Liraglutide may cause degradation of liraglutide. In the absence of compatibility studies, Liraglutide must not be mixed with other medicinal products.\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\nOral Contraceptives: Liraglutide lowered ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product.

There is no need to start the series over again, regardless of the time elapsed between doses.\n\nRoutine booster injections: To maintain adequate protection, a booster dose of 0.5 ml of adsorbed tetanus vaccine every 10 years thereafter is recommended.\n\nVaccination of injured persons:\nClean and minor wound: \n•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, no need of additional vaccine.\n•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.\n\nAll other dirty wounds (contaminated with feces, soil, and saliva): \n•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose within previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml required.\n•	If primary immunization confirmed and receiving booster dose more than previous 5 years, 1 dose of 0.5 ml along with tetanus immunoglobulin required.\n\nIf a person has no previous vaccination or uncertain, the primary series of 3 doses of 0.5ml adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be given along with tetanus immunoglobulin with 1st dose.\nProtection of neonatal tetanus\nFor prevention of neonatal tetanus, adsorbed tetanus vaccine is recommended for immunization of women of childbearing age.\n \nFor pregnant woman who have not had previous immunization, 2 doses of tetanus toxoid at four weeks interval preferably during the last two trimester or at least 2 weeks before delivery should be given during pregnancy so that protective antibody would be transferred to the infant in order to prevent neonatal tetanus. e.g. 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 6th month of pregnancy and 1 dose of 0.5 ml at 7th month of pregnancy.\n\nPregnant woman who have completed the course of tetanus, next 10 years no need of additional dose during pregnancy. Thereafter a single booster dose would be sufficient to extend immunity.\n\nContra-indication\nIt is a contraindication to use this or any other related vaccine after a serious adverse event temporally associated with a previous dose including an anaphylactic reaction. A history of systemic allergic or neurologic reactions following a previous dose of Tetanus Toxoid is an absolute contraindication for further use. \n\nIf a contraindication to using tetanus toxoid -containing preparations exists in a person who has not completed a primary immunizing course of tetanus toxoid and other than a clean, minor wound is sustained; only passive immunization should be given using TIG (Human). \n\nElective immunization should be deferred during the course of any febrile illness or acute infection. A minor afebrile illness such as a mild upper respiratory infection should not preclude immunization. Elective immunization procedures should be deferred during an outbreak of poliomyelitis. \n\nSide effects\nMild inj site reactions eg transient swelling, rash, fever, malaise, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, pruritus, dizziness.Potentially Fatal: Anaphylactic reactions. \nPrecaution\nDo not administer IV. Use subcutaneous route in bleeding disorders. Withhold vaccination in moderate or severe febrile illness.

Yellow fever Virus (Live attenuated) Vaccine	\nPharmadesh Ltd.\tStamaril Injection  1000u/0.5ml 1's pack 1000.63\nindication\nY\nDose\nPrimary Vaccination: Adults and Children >9 months: 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine administered as a single dose.\n\nChildren <9 months: The vaccine must not be given to children <6 months. Vaccination against yellow fever is not usually recommended in children aged from 6 months up to 9 months except in specific circumstances and in accordance with available official recommendations, in which case, the dose is the same as in older children and adults.\n\nThe vaccine should be given at least 10 days before entering an endemic area since protective immunity may not be achieved until at least this time has elapsed.\n\nElderly: The dose is the same as for adults. However, due to a higher risk of yellow fever vaccine-associated severe and potentially fatal disease in persons from 60 years of age, the vaccine should only be given when it is considered that there is a considerable and unavoidable risk of acquiring yellow fever infection.\n\nRe-Vaccination: Re-vaccination with 1 dose of 0.5mL is recommended every 10 years in persons considered to be at risk of exposure. International Health Regulations (IHR) require re-vaccination, using the same dose as for primary vaccination, at intervals of 10 years in order to retain a valid certificate.\n\nFor IM use, the recommended injection sites are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in the infants and toddlers (6 months up to 2 years of age) and the deltoid muscle in older children and adults.\n\nContra-indication\nHypersensitivity reaction to eggs, chicken proteins or to any component of this vaccine.\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any yellow fever vaccine.\nImmunosuppression, whether congenital, idiopathic or as a result of treatment with systemic steroids (greater than the standard dose of topical or inhaled steroids), radiotherapy or cytotoxic drugs.\nHistory of thymus dysfunction (including thymoma, thymectomy).\nSymptomatic HIV infection.\nAsymptomatic HIV infection when accompanied by evidence of impaired immune function (see Precautions).\nAge <6 months (see Dosage & Administration and Precautions).\nCurrent severe febrile illness.\nSide effects\n Hypersensitivity. The most common adverse reactions occurring after vaccine administration were local reactions. Nervous System Disorders: Very Common: Headache.\nGastrointestinal System Disorders: Common: Nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting. Uncommon: Abdominal pain.\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Common: Myalgia. Uncommon: Arthralgia.\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Very Common: Local reactions (including pain, redness, hematoma, induration, swelling). Common: Pyrexia, asthenia.\nPrecaution\nAs with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reaction following administration of the vaccine.\nStamaril should be administered only to persons who are or will be at risk of infection with yellow fever virus or who must be vaccinated to comply with IHR.\nImmunosuppressed Persons:It must not be administered to immunosuppressed persons.\nChildren Born to HIV Positive Mothers: Children aged at least 6 months may be vaccinated if it is confirmed that they are not infected with HIV.\nHIV-infected children aged at least 6 months who are potentially in need of protection against yellow fever should be referred to a specialist paediatric team for advice on whether or not to vaccinate.\n This vaccine must not be administered to children before the age of 6 months.\n\nSixty Years and Older: Some serious and potentially fatal adverse reactions (including systemic and neurological reactions persisting >48 hrs, YEL-AVD and YEL-AND) appear to occur at higher frequencies after the age of 60 years. Therefore, the vaccine should only be given to those who have a considerable risk of acquiring yellow fever.\nBecause IM injection can cause injection site haematoma, Stamaril should not be given by the IM route to persons with any bleeding disorder, eg, haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or to persons on anticoagulant therapy. The subcutaneous route of administration should be used instead.\nPatients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this vaccine.\n\n\nMode of action\nImmunosuppressants eg cytotoxic agents, systemic steroids.\nPregnancy categoryD\ninteraction\nImmunosuppressants eg cytotoxic agents, systemic steroids.

Max: 450 mg as a single dose.\nContra-indication\nIt is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder. Bupropion Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients treated with other medications that contain Bupropion because the incidence of seizure is\ndose dependent. Bupropion may induce seizure and consequently its use is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy. The drug is also contraindicated in patients with a current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or\nanorexia nervosa because of a higher incidence of seizures noted in such patients treated for bulimia with Bupropion Hydrochloride. The concurrent administration of Bupropion Hydrochloride and\na monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor is contraindicated. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of MAO inhibitor and initiation of treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride. Bupropion Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown an allergic response to\nBupropion or the other ingredients that make up Bupropion Hydrochloride.\nSide effects\nAgitation, anxiety, and insomnia often occur during the initial stages of Bupropion therapy. Other relatively common side effects reported with Bupropion include fever, dry mouth, headache or migraine, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, tremor, sweating, and skin rashes.\nHypersensitivity reactions, ranging from pruritus and urticaria, less commonly, angio-oedema, dyspnoea, and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.\nPrecaution\nIt should be used with extreme caution, in patients with history of seizure disorders or in patients with other predisposing factors such as severe hepatic cirrhosis or a CNS tumour, and in those undergoing abrupt withdrawal from alcohol or Benzodiazepines. The use of Bupropion in patients with other risk factors for seizures (for example, alcohol abuse, a history of head trauma, diabetes, and drugs known to lower the seizure threshold) should only be undertaken when there are compelling clinical\nreasons. Bupropion should be used with caution in patients with bipolar depression or psychoses and in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease and in hepatic or renal\nimpairment. \nMode of action\nNeuroleptics, lithium and TCAs, benzodiazepine, alcohol, drugs that lower seizure threshold. Increased risk of side effects when co-admin with levodopa. Reduced hepatic clearance with fluoxetine. Caution when administering with agents that will affect hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes. Increased risk of toxicity when used with ritonavir.\nPotentially Fatal: Concurrent use with MAO inhibitors may cause acute toxicity symptoms and increased risk of fatality.\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\nNeuroleptics, lithium and TCAs, benzodiazepine, alcohol, drugs that lower seizure threshold.

If the effect of 30 mg is insufficient and the side effects are acceptable, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg.\n\nElderly (>65 years): Safety and efficacy of Dapoxetine have not been established in patients >65 years as limited data are available in this population.\n\nChildren and Adolescents: Dapoxetine should not be used in individuals <18 years.\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment is required but caution is advised in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Dapoxetine is not recommended for use in the patients with severe renal impairment.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Dapoxetine is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.\n\nBefore treatment is initiated, the physician should obtain a careful medical history focusing on past orthostatic events and also perform an orthostatic test (blood pressure and pulse rate, supine and standing). If the patient discloses a history suggestive of orthostatic reactions or an orthostatic test shows this kind of reaction, treatment with Dapoxetine should be avoided.\nContra-indication\nKnown hypersensitivity to dapoxetine HCl or to any of the excipients.\nPatients with significant pathological cardiac conditions [eg, heart failure (NYHA class II-IV), conduction abnormalities (2nd- or 3rd-degree AV block or sick sinus syndrome) not treated with a permanent pacemaker, significant ischemic heart disease or significant valvular disease].\nConcomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI. Similarly, a MAOI should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.\n\nConcomitant treatment with thioridazine, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with thioridazine. Similarly, thioridazine should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.\n\nConcomitant treatment with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)] or other medicinal/herbal products with serotonergic effects or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with these medicinal/herbal products. Similarly these medicinal/herbal products should not be administered within 7 days after Dapoxetine has been discontinued.\nSide effects\nSyncope characterized as loss of consciousness has been reported.The majority of cases occurred during the first 3 hrs after dosing, after the 1st dose or associated with study-related procedures in the clinic setting (eg, blood draw and orthostatic maneuvers and blood pressure measurements). Prodromal symptoms often preceded the syncope.\nOrthostatic hypotension has been reported in clinical trials.\n\nThe most common adverse drug reactions (5%) reported during clinical trials were headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, insomnia and fatigue. The most common events leading to discontinuation were nausea and dizziness.\nPrecaution\nGeneral: Dapoxetine is only indicated in men with PE. Safety has not been established and there are no data on the ejaculation-delaying effects in men without PE.\n\nUse with Recreational Drugs: Patients should be advised not to use Dapoxetine in combination with recreational drugs. Recreational drugs with serotonergic activity eg, ketamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may lead to potentially serious reactions if combined with Dapoxetine. These reactions include, but are not limited to, arrhythmia, hyperthermia and serotonin syndrome. \n\nUse of Dapoxetine with recreational drugs with sedative properties eg, narcotics and benzodiazepines may further increase somnolence and dizziness.\n\nEthanol: Combining alcohol with Dapoxetine may increase alcohol-related neurocognitive effects and may also enhance neurocardiogenic adverse events eg, syncope, thereby increasing the risk of accidental injury; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking Dapoxetine.\n\nPossibly prodromal symptoms eg, nausea, dizziness/lightheadedness and diaphoresis were reported more frequently among patients treated with Dapoxetine compared to placebo.\n\nOrthostatic Hypotension: An orthostatic test should be performed before initiating therapy. In case of a history of documented or suspected orthostatic reaction, treatment with Dapoxetine should be avoided.\n\nDapoxetine is not indicated for psychiatric disorders and should not be used in men with these disorders eg, schizophrenia, or in those suffering with co-morbid depression, as worsening of symptoms associated with depression cannot be excluded.\n\nWithdrawal Effects: Abrupt discontinuation of chronically administered SSRIs used to treat chronic depressive disorders has been reported to result in the following symptoms: Dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (eg, paresthesias, electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia and hypomania.\nMode of action\nPotential serious reactions w/ MAOIs.

Vitamin B1 + Vitamin B2 + Nicotinamide + Vitamin B6 + Pantothenic Acid + Vitamin C + Biotin + Folic Acid + Vitamin B12 Inj	\nAcme Ltd.\tArovital Injection  1's vial 200\nindication\nI\nDose\nAdults: For adult patients and children weighing 10 kg or more, the recommended daily doses are the content of 1 vial (10 ml).\n\nChildren: Children weighing less than 10 kg should be given 1/10 of the content of one vial i.e. 1 ml per kg body weight per day.\nContra-indication\nHypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the preparation. \nSide effects\nThe unwanted effects of nutrient solutions are a rise in the body temperature, shivering, chills and nausea and vomiting. Other rare unwanted effects include: allergic reactions; breathing difficulties (rapid breathing, shortness of breath); effects on blood pressure, abdominal pain, tiredness, headaches, flushing, slight pressure over the eyes and dizziness. \nPrecaution\nAdministering folic acid may obscure pernicious anemia. In patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), routine supplementation with both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins is recommended to prevent deficiency states and to obviate the need to speculate on individual vitamin status. Daily vitamin requirements must be calculated to avoid over dosage and toxic effects, especially with regards to vitamins A & D and particularly in pediatric patients. In patients for whom total parenteral nutrition is continued for prolonged periods (months or years), periodic monitoring of blood vitamin levels should be considered. To prevent excessive excretion of water-soluble vitamins and for reasons of safety, daily dosage should be administered over a number of hours. \nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryNot Classified\ninteraction\n
Clarithromycin + Metronidazole + Lansoprazol	\nAristopharma\tPylopac TAB dr  7's pack 315\nindication\nH\nDose\nOne strip lansoprazole, 30 mg; clarithromycin, 500 mg; and metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 7-14 days or as per the physicians advice. \nContra-indication\nContraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to any component. Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin should not be given to patients with history of QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes. \nSide effects\nAdverse reactions which were reported as possibly or probably related to treatment (<3%) in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly are listed below and divided by body systems. Digestive system : nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dark stool, glossitis, oral moniliasis, stomatitis, tongue discoloration, Musculoskeletal System : myalgia, Nervous System : confusion, headache, dizziness, Skin : skin reactions, Urological System : vaginitis, vaginal moniliasis. \nPrecaution\nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy, including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.\nMode of action\nClarithromycin: Reduced efficacy w/ CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine). Strong inducers of CYP450 system (e.g. efavirenz, rifampicin) may accelerate metabolism, thus lower plasma levels of clarithromycin. Inhibition of metabolism w/ ritonavir.

Eslicarbazepine	\nApex\tEslicar TAB dr 400mg 10's pack \nindication\nP\nDose\nAdult: PO: The recommended starting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one or two weeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily.\n\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of eslicarbazepine acetate in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been established.\nContra-indication\nHypersensitivity to the active substance, to other carboxamide derivatives (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) or to any of the excipients. Second or third degree atrioventricular (AV) block.\nSide effects\nAllergic reactions: May cause serious skin rash or other serious allergic reactions\nVery common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) side effects are:\n• Feeling dizzy or sleepy.\nCommon (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) side effects are:\n• Feeling unsteady or having a sensation of spinning or floating;\n• Feeling sick or vomiting;\n• Headache;\n• Diarrhoea;\n• Seeing double or blurred vision;\n• Difficulty in concentration;\n• Feeling low in energy or tired;\n• Shaking;\n• Skin rash;\n• Blood tests showing that you have low levels of sodium in your blood;\n• Decrease of appetite;\n• Difficulty in sleeping;\n• Difficulty in coordinating movements (ataxia).\nPrecaution\nSuicidal ideation\nSuicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic active substances in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials of anti-epileptic medicinal products has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. Therefore, patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge.\nNervous system disorders\nEslicarbazepine acetate has been associated with some central nervous system adverse reactions, such as dizziness and somnolence, which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury.\nOral contraceptives\nEslicarbazepine acetate may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended\nOther warnings and precautions\nIf Eslicarbazepine is to be discontinued it is recommended to withdraw it gradually to minimise the potential of increased seizure frequency.\nConcomitant use of eslicarbazepine acetate with oxcarbazepine is not recommended because this may cause overexposure to the active metabolites.\nHyponatraemia\nHyponatraemia has been reported as an adverse reaction in 1.2% of patients treated with Eslicarbazepine. Hyponatraemia is asymptomatic in most cases, however, it may be accompanied by clinical symptoms like worsening of seizures, confusion, decreased consciousness. Frequency of hyponatraemia increased with increasing eslicarbazepine acetate dose. In patients with pre-existing renal disease leading to hyponatraemia, or in patients concomitantly treated with medicinal products which may themselves lead to hyponatraemia (e.g. diuretics, desmopressin, carbamazepine), serum sodium levels should be examined before and during treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate. Furthermore, serum sodium levels should be determined if clinical signs of hyponatraemia occur. Apart from this, sodium levels should be determined during routine laboratory examination. If clinically-relevant hyponatraemia develops, eslicarbazepine acetate should be discontinued.\nPR interval\nProlongations in PR interval have been observed in clinical studies with eslicarbazepine acetate.\nCaution should be exercised in patients with medical conditions (e.g. low levels of thyroxine, cardiac conduction abnormalities), or when taking concomitant medicinal products known to be associated with PR prolongation.\nRenal impairment\nCaution should be exercised in the treatment of patients with renal impairment and the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance. In patients with CLCR <30 ml/min use is not recommended due to insufficient data.\nHepatic impairment\nAs clinical data are limited in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and pharmacokinetic and clinical data are missing in patients with severe hepatic impairment, eslicarbazepine acetate should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.\n\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryC\ninteraction\n

Insulin degludec + Insulin aspart 70/30 premixed	\nDelta Pharma\tRyzodeg FlexTouch Injection 100IU/ml  \nindication\nT\nDose\nAdult: SC: This is a soluble insulin product consisting of the basal insulin degludec and the rapid-acting prandial insulin aspart.\nThis can be administered once- or twice-daily with the main meal(s). When needed, the patient can change the time of administration as long as this insulin is dosed with the largest meal when taken once daily.\nIn patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus this insulin can be administered alone, in combination with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products, and in combination with bolus insulin.\nIn type 1 diabetes mellitus, this insulin is combined with short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals.\nThis is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient’s needs. Dose-adjustments are recommended to be primarily based on fasting plasma glucose measurements.\n\nInitiation\nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\nThe recommended total daily starting dose is 10 units with meal(s) followed by individual dosage adjustments.\nPatients with type 1 diabetes mellitus\nThe recommended starting dose is 60–70% of the total daily insulin requirements. This is to be used once-daily at meal-time in combination.\n\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nThiss insulin can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.\n\nContra-indication\nHypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.\nSide effects\nThe most frequently reported adverse reaction during treatment is hypoglycaemia.  \nImmune system disorders\nWith insulin preparations, allergic reactions may occur. Immediate-type allergic reactions to either insulin itself or the excipients may potentially be life-threatening.\nWith Ryzodeg, hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhoea, nausea, tiredness and itching) and urticaria were reported rarely.\n\nLipodystrophy\nLipodystrophy (including lipohypertrophy, lipoatrophy) may occur at the injection site. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the particular injection area may help to reduce the risk of developing these reactions.\nInjection site reactions\nInjection site reactions (including injection site haematoma, pain, haemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discolouration, pruritus, warmth and injection site mass) occurred in patients treated with\nRyzodeg. These reactions are usually mild and transitory and they normally disappear during continued treatment.\n\n\nPrecaution\nHypoglycaemia\nOmission of a meal or unplanned strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Concomitant illness, especially infections and fever, usually increases the patient's insulin requirement. Concomitant diseases in the kidney, liver or diseases affecting the adrenal, pituitary or thyroid gland may require changes in the insulin dose.\n\n\nHyperglycaemia\nAdministration of rapid-acting insulin is recommended in situations with severe hyperglycaemia. Inadequate dosing and/or discontinuation of treatment in patients requiring insulin may lead to hyperglycaemia and potentially to diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, concomitant illness, especially infections, may lead to hyperglycaemia and thereby cause an increased insulin requirement.\n\nEye disorder\nIntensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, while long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nAvoidance of accidental mix-ups\nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental mix-ups between Ryzodeg and other insulin products.\n\nOlder patients (? 65 years old)\nRyzodeg can be used in older patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.\n\nPaediatric population\nRyzodeg has been administered to children and adolescents up to 18 years of age for the investigation of pharmacokinetic properties. Safety and efficacy have not been investigated in children and adolescents.\n\n\n\nMode of action\nNone\nPregnancy categoryB\ninteraction\n

Refined Soyabean Oil + Purified Egg Lecithin + Glycerol (10% fat emulsion)	\nGlobe\tFatisol IV injection 10g+1.2g+2.25g 100ml/250ml/500ml tube 800.85/510.43/334.42\nindication\n \nDose\nTotal Parenteral nutrition: As a part of TPN, administer IV via a peripheral vein or by central venous catheter. Fat emulsion should comprise no more than 60% of the patient""'s total caloric intake, with carbohydrates and amino acids comprising the remaining 40% or more of caloric intake. \n\nAdult: Initial infusion rate is 1ml/min for the first 15 to 30 mins. If no adverse reactions occur, the infusion rate can be increased to 2 ml/min. Infuse only 500 ml the first day and increase dose the following day. Do not exceed a daily dosage of 2.5 g/kg. \nChildren: Initial infusion rate is 0.1ml/min for the first 10 to 15 mins. If no adverse reactions occur, the infusion rate can be increased to 1g/kg in 4 hours. Do not exceed a daily dosage of 3 g/kg. \nInfants: Starts at 0.5g/kg/24 hours and may be increased in relation to the infant's ability to eliminate fat. The maximum recommended dosage is 3g/kg/24 hours. \nFatty acid deficiency: To correct EFAD, supply 8% to 10% of the caloric intake by IV fat emulsion to provide an adequate amount of linoleic acid. \nContra-indication\nIt is contraindicated in conditions with severely disordered fat metabolism, such as in severe liver damage and acute shock. Hypersensitivity to egg-, soya- or peanut protein or to any of active substances or excipients.\nSide effects\nThis may cause a rise in body temperature (incidence <3%) and, less frequently, shivering, chills and nausea/vomiting (incidence <1%). Reports of other adverse events in conjunction with 10% fat emulsion infusion are extremely rare, less than one report of certain events per one million infusions. Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic reaction, skin rash, urticaria), respiratory symptoms (tachypnoea) and circulatory effects (hypertension, hypotension) have been described. \nThrombosis, haemolysis, reticulocytosis, abdominal pain, tiredness, priapism and neurological adverse reactions including headaches, flushing, dyspnoea, slight pressure over the eyes and dizziness have been reported.\nPrecaution\nThis contains soya oil and egg lecithin which may rarely cause allergic reactions. Cross allergic reaction has been observed between soya-bean and peanut. Fat metabolism may be disturbed in conditions such as renal insufficiency, uncompensated diabetes, pancreatitis, certain forms of liver insufficiency, metabolic disorders and sepsis. Fatisol should be administered with caution as a strong correlation exists between C-reactive protein and the agglutination of Fatisol in seriously ill patients. \n\nIt should be given with caution to neonates and premature infants with hyperbilirubinaemia and in cases with suspected pulmonary hypertension. In low birthweight infants, the risk of lipid infusions may outweigh potential benefits due to further diminution of defences against infection. In infants, metabolism of lipids in peripheral tissues may be diminished by infection and heparin administration. In neonates receiving long term parenteral nutrition, particularly premature neonates, platelet count, liver function tests and serum triglyceride concentration should be monitored. Use in Pregnancy & Lactation: Absolute safety of the foetus and the nursing infant has not been established.
